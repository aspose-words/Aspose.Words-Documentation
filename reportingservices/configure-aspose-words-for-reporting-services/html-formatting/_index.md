{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

RDL reports used in Reporting Services 2000 and 2005 do not support differently formatted text within a single textbox (i.e. all text in a textbox shares the same formatting). 

{{% /alert %}} 

However, Aspose.Words for Reporting Services offers a workaround that you can use to achieve full rich formatting within a textbox in RDL reports. 

To do this you need to enable a special mode where all text in textboxes is treated as HTML. For example, to have normal, bold and italic text in the same textbox, enter the following textbox value: 

Some of this text is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and other text is &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;. 

When exported, the text will look like: 

Some of this text is **bold** and other text is *italic*. 

**Note however that this feature has some serious limitations, some of which are:** 

- The formatting is not visible at design time (in Report Builder, Report Manager etc). Instead, you will see the HTML text as is. 
- Aspose.Words for Reporting Services is the only rendering extension able to understand and properly format HTML code in textboxes. 
- Since the text is contained in textboxes, all the corresponding restrictions apply. For example, you cannot have form fields within a textbox. 
- If HTML text is spread over multiple pages, most likely it will be exported as plain text. 

To instruct the renderer to parse HTML formatting in textboxes, add the following lines to the *&lt;Extension&gt;* element corresponding to a particular renderer: 

{{< highlight csharp >}}
<Render>
...
<Extension Name="AWDOC" Type="Aspose.Words.ReportingServices.DocRenderer,Aspose.Words.ReportingServices">
<Configuration>
    <DeviceInfo>
        <EnableHTMLFormatting>True</EnableHTMLFormatting>
    </DeviceInfo>
</Configuration>
</Extension>
</Render>
{{< /highlight >}}
