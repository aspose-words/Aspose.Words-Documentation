This is a hotfix release addressing some recent issues reported by customers.

- Added the PageBorderLayout configuration setting. It allows to choose between the "natural" page border in Microsoft Word documents (a box per page) and the "continuous" border similar to that exported by the Microsoft renderers such as PDF.
- 3479 - Hidden table columns were visible.
  Corrupted DOC documents were produced when delivering reports with file share subscription. 
  Page (body) border was aligned incorrectly due to the wrong positioning of headers and footers.
