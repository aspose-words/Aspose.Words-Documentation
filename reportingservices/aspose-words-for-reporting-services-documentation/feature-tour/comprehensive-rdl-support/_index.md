Aspose.Words for Reporting Services fully supports all of the RDL specification. This has two great advantages:

- **No need to redesign existing reports.** You can export any existing RDL report as a Microsoft Word document and it will appear exactly according to the RDL design.
- **No need to use a specific report designer.** You can use any RDL report designer and the report will be exported exactly the way you’ve designed it.
