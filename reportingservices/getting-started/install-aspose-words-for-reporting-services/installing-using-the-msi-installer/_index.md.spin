Run *Aspose.Words.ReportingServices.msi* and follow the steps offered by the installer.

The installer will perform the following steps: 

- Copy assemblies and help files to the specified directory. 
- Copy and register the product with all Reporting Services instances of all SQL Server versions found on the machine. 
- Integrate the product with Business Intelligence Development Studio if it is detected on the machine. 

You do not need to copy or modify any files manually unless you want to ad d special configuration parameters. 

Using the MSI installer is the best option because it works in most cases. However, you may want to install the product manually in the following situations: 

- Automatic installation fails due to some error such as a security issue. 
- You want to install the product on specific instances of Reporting Services only. 
- You have Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services installed on your computer but only want to use Aspose.Words for Reporting Services with Report Viewer.
