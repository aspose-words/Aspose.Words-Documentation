- SharePoint lists via CAML queries.
- XML data files located in a SharePoint document library.

In a report definition file the following report properties are specified:

- Data source connection properties.
- Queries to retrieve the data.
- Relationships between data tables returned by different queries.

You can specify multiple data source connections and queries. You can combine data returned by the different queries using data relationships in the report definition file.Â You can store data source connection description in a separate file and use it with multiple reports.
