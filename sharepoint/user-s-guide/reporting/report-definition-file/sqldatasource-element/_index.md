This element contains information about a connection to a Microsoft SQL server database. .NET SqlClient is used for the connection. You can use it only with [SqlQuery](/words/sharepoint/sqlquery-element/) elements to define queries. Please note that storing database user name and password in the connection string may be insecure.
