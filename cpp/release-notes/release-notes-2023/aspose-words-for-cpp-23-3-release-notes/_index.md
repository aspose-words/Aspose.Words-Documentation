## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 23.3. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added new public properties for working with fill colors

A new public properties ForeThemeColor and BackThemeColor has been added to class Fill.
{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// Gets a ThemeColor object that represents the foreground color for the fill.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor get_ForeThemeColor();

/// Sets a ThemeColor object that represents the foreground color for the fill.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_ForeThemeColor(Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor value);

/// Gets a ThemeColor object that represents the background color for the fill.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor get_BackThemeColor();

/// Sets a ThemeColor object that represents the background color for the fill.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_BackThemeColor(Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor value);
{{< /highlight >}}

A new public properties ForeTintAndShade and BackTintAndShade has been added to class Fill.
{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// Gets or sets a double value that lightens or darkens the foreground color.
///
/// The allowed values are within the range from -1 (the darkest) to 1 (the lightest) for this property.
/// Zero (0) is neutral. Attempting to set this property to a value less than -1 or more than 1
/// results in <see cref="System::ArgumentOutOfRangeException">ArgumentOutOfRangeException</see>.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API double get_ForeTintAndShade();

/// Setter for Aspose::Words::Drawing::Fill::get_ForeTintAndShade
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_ForeTintAndShade(double value);

/// Gets or sets a double value that lightens or darkens the background color.
///
/// The allowed values are within the range from -1 (the darkest) to 1 (the lightest) for this property.
/// Zero (0) is neutral. Attempting to set this property to a value less than -1 or more than 1
/// results in <see cref="System::ArgumentOutOfRangeException">ArgumentOutOfRangeException</see>.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API double get_BackTintAndShade();

/// Setter for Aspose::Words::Drawing::Fill::get_BackTintAndShade
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_BackTintAndShade(double value);
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Use Case:
Explains how to work with theme colors and tint and shade.
{{< highlight cpp >}}
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"in.docx");

System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Drawing::Fill> shapeFill = (System::AsCast<Aspose::Words::Drawing::Shape>(doc->GetChild(Aspose::Words::NodeType::Shape, 0, true)))->get_Fill();
// Gets and sets the value of theme colors.
if (shapeFill->get_ForeThemeColor() == Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor::Accent1)
{
    shapeFill->set_ForeThemeColor(Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor::Dark1);
}

if (shapeFill->get_BackThemeColor() == Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor::Accent2)
{
    shapeFill->set_BackThemeColor(Aspose::Words::Themes::ThemeColor::Dark2);
}

System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Drawing::Fill> textFill1 = doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_FirstParagraph()->get_Runs()->idx_get(0)->get_Font()->get_Fill();
// Gets and sets the tint value.
if (textFill1->get_ForeTintAndShade() == 0)
{
    textFill1->set_ForeTintAndShade(0.5);
}

System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Drawing::Fill> textFill2 = doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_FirstParagraph()->get_Runs()->idx_get(1)->get_Font()->get_Fill();
// Gets and sets the shade value.
if (textFill2->get_ForeTintAndShade() == 0)
{
    textFill2->set_ForeTintAndShade(-0.2);
}

doc->Save(u"out.docx");

### Added public properties HasMajorGridlines and HasMinorGridlines to ChartAxis class

The following public properties have been added to the Aspose.Words.Drawing.Charts.ChartAxis class:
{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// Gets a flag indicating whether the axis has major gridlines.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API bool get_HasMajorGridlines();

/// Sets a flag indicating whether the axis has major gridlines.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_HasMajorGridlines(bool value);

/// Gets a flag indicating whether the axis has minor gridlines.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API bool get_HasMinorGridlines();

/// Sets a flag indicating whether the axis has minor gridlines.
ASPOSE_WORDS_SHARED_API void set_HasMinorGridlines(bool value);
{{< /highlight >}}

// Insert a chart.
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Drawing::Shape> shape = builder->InsertChart(Aspose::Words::Drawing::Charts::ChartType::Column, 432, 252);
    
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Drawing::Charts::ChartAxis> xAxis = shape->get_Chart()->get_AxisX();
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Drawing::Charts::ChartAxis> yAxis = shape->get_Chart()->get_AxisY();
    
// Show gridlines.
xAxis->set_HasMajorGridlines(true);
xAxis->set_HasMinorGridlines(true);
yAxis->set_HasMajorGridlines(true);
yAxis->set_HasMinorGridlines(true);
    
doc->Save(u"Gridlines.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property ImportFormatOptions.AdjustSentenceAndWordSpacing

The following public property was added to Aspose.Words.ImportFormatOptions class:

builder = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::DocumentBuilder>(dstDoc);
builder->Write(u"Lorem ipsum.");
    
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::ImportFormatOptions> options = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::ImportFormatOptions>();
options->set_AdjustSentenceAndWordSpacing(true);
builder->InsertDocument(srcDoc, Aspose::Words::ImportFormatMode::UseDestinationStyles, options);
    
System::Console::WriteLine(dstDoc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_FirstParagraph()->GetText());
    
/* This code produces the following output (please note the additional ' ' space character just before pasted content):
Lorem ipsum. Dolor sit amet.
*/
{{< /highlight >}}

shape->get_TextBox()->set_NoTextRotation(true);

- The current release does not support LINQ and Reporting features.
- The current release does not support OpenGL 3D Shapes rendering.
- The current release does not support loading PDF documents.
- The current release has limited support for database features - C++ doesn't have common API for DB like .NET System.Data.
