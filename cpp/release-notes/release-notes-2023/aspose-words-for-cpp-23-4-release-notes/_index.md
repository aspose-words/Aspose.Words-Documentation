## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 23.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to set distance between table and surrounding text

Now you can set the following properties of the **Table** class:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
    /// Gets or sets distance between table left and the surrounding text, in points.
    ///
    /// @par Examples
    ///
    /// Shows the minimum distance operations between table boundaries and text.
    /// @code
    /// auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(MyDir + u"Table wrapped by text.docx");
    ///
    /// SharedPtr<Table> table = doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_Tables()->idx_get(0);
    ///
    /// ASPOSE_ASSERT_EQ(25.9, table->get_DistanceTop());
    /// ASPOSE_ASSERT_EQ(25.9, table->get_DistanceBottom());

        }
    }
    
    // Hide the major grid lines on the primary and secondary Y axes.
    
    {
        auto axis_enumerator = (chart->get_Axes())->GetEnumerator();
        while (axis_enumerator->MoveNext())
        {
            auto&& axis = axis_enumerator->get_Current();
