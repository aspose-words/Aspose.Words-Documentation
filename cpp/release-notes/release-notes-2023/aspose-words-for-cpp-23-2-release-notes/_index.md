## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 23.2. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added public property Document.IncludeTextboxesFootnotesEndnotesInStat

The following public property was added to the **Aspose.Words.Document** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies whether to include textboxes, footnotes and endnotes in word count statistics.
/// </summary>
bool get_IncludeTextboxesFootnotesEndnotesInStat();
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to include or exclude textboxes, footnotes and endnotes from word count statistics. Please see the following code example:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>();
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::DocumentBuilder> builder = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::DocumentBuilder>(doc);

builder->Writeln(u"Lorem ipsum");
builder->InsertFootnote(Aspose::Words::Notes::FootnoteType::Footnote, u"sit amet");

// Check the option is set to 'false' by default when a new document is created.
System::Console::WriteLine(u"By default for new document this option is set to '{0}'", doc->get_IncludeTextboxesFootnotesEndnotesInStat());
doc->UpdateWordCount();
System::Console::WriteLine(u"Words count without textboxes, footnotes and endnotes: {0}", doc->get_BuiltInDocumentProperties()->get_Words());

// Change option.
doc->set_IncludeTextboxesFootnotesEndnotesInStat(true);
doc->UpdateWordCount();

System::Console::WriteLine(u"Words count with textboxes, footnotes and endnotes: {0}", doc->get_BuiltInDocumentProperties()->get_Words());

/* This code produces the following output:
By default for new document this option is set to 'False'
Words count without textboxes, footnotes and endnotes: 2
Words count with textboxes, footnotes and endnotes: 4
*/
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property Document.JustificationMode

A new public property **JustificationMode** has been added to the **Document** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// Gets the character spacing adjustment of a document.
Aspose::Words::Settings::JustificationMode get_JustificationMode();

/// Sets the character spacing adjustment of a document.
void set_JustificationMode(Aspose::Words::Settings::JustificationMode value);
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to get and set the character spacing adjustment of a document. Please see the following code example:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"in.docx");

// Getting JustificationMode.
Aspose::Words::Settings::JustificationMode justificationMode = doc->get_JustificationMode();
if (justificationMode == Aspose::Words::Settings::JustificationMode::Expand)
{
    // Setting JustificationMode.
    doc->set_JustificationMode(Aspose::Words::Settings::JustificationMode::Compress);
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property Style.AutomaticallyUpdate

A new public property **AutomaticallyUpdate** has been added to thr **Style** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// Specifies whether this style is automatically redefined based on the appropriate value.
///
/// If the property value is set to true, MS Word automatically redefines the current style when
/// the appropriate paragraph formatting has been changed.
///
/// AutomaticallyUpdate property is applicable to paragraph styles only.
///
/// The default value is <c>%false</c>.
bool get_AutomaticallyUpdate() const;

/// Setter for Aspose::Words::Style::get_AutomaticallyUpdate
void set_AutomaticallyUpdate(bool value);
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to get and set **AutomaticallyUpdate** property of a Style. Please see the following code example to learn how to use such a property:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"in.docx");
// Getting AutomaticallyUpdate.
if (!doc->get_Styles()->idx_get(Aspose::Words::StyleIdentifier::Normal)->get_AutomaticallyUpdate())
{
    System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Style> style = doc->get_Styles()->Add(Aspose::Words::StyleType::Paragraph, u"Redefined");
    style->set_BaseStyleName(u"Normal");
    // Setting AutomaticallyUpdate.
    style->set_AutomaticallyUpdate(true);
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added support for MOBI export

Aspose.Words now can export documents to MOBI file format.

MOBI (also called PRC, AZW) is Amazon Kindle's proprietary e-book file format.

The following publicly visible enum values were added:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
FileFormat::Mobi
SaveFormat::Mobi
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to save a document to MOBI file format. Please see the following code example:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"in.docx");
doc->Save(u"out.mobi");
{{< /highlight >}}

or

{{< highlight csharp >}}
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"in.docx");
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Saving::HtmlSaveOptions> options = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Saving::HtmlSaveOptions>(Aspose::Words::SaveFormat::Mobi);
doc->Save(u"out.mobi", options);
{{< /highlight >}}
