## Major Features

We have reworked culture related subsystem of the library and have made it more similar to Aspose.Words for .Net and .Net in general - number and date formatting and parsing, conversion between different encoding, etc.

## Limitations and API Differences

Aspose.Words for C++ has some differences as compared to its equivalent .NET version of the API. This section contains information about all such functionality that is not available in the current release.
