## Major Features

This is a patch release.

- We have moved WebExtension related classes to a proper namespace - from Aspose::Words::Model::WebExtensions to Aspose::Words::WebExtensions (the same as in the Aspose.Words for .Net)
- We have updated dependency from CodePorting.Native.Cs2Cpp to version 19.11

## Limitations and API Differences

Aspose.Words for C++ has some differences as compared to its equivalent .NET version of the API. This section contains information about all such functionality that is not available in the current release.
The missing features will be added in future releases.

- The current release doesn't support cryptography features - it can't verify, sign, encrypt or decrypt documents.

- The current release doesn't support Metered license.
- The current release doesn't support a multipage TIFF format.
- The current release doesn't support LINQ and Reporting features.

- The current release only supports Microsoft Visual C++ version 2015 or higher and only for the x64 platform.
