## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new mode for import HTML block-level elements during inserting HTML via DocumentBuilder.InsertHtml() method

Related issue: WORDSNET-23654

New HTML insertion option was added to HtmlInsertOptions enum.
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    enum class HtmlInsertOptions
    {
    /// <summary>
    /// Preserve properties of block-level elements.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// By default, properties of parent blocks are merged and stored on their child elements (i.e. paragraphs or tables).
    /// If this option is specified, properties of each block are stored separately in a special logical structure.
    /// As a result, this option allows to better preserve individual borders and margins seen in the HTML document
    /// and get better conversion results. The downside is that the resulting document gets harder to modify, since borders
    /// and margins stored in the logical structure are not available for editing.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Only margins and borders of 'body', 'div', and 'blockquote' HTML elements are preserved. Properties of each HTML
    /// element are stored separately.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// If this option is specified, Aspose.Words mimics MS Word's behavior regarding import of block properties.
    /// </para>
    /// </remarks>
    PreserveBlocks = 4
    };
{{< /highlight >}}

The new mode of import HTML block-level elements during inserting HTML via DocumentBuilder.InsertHtml() method allows to better preserve borders and margins seen in the HTML document and get better conversion results.
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    auto html = u"
    <html>
        <div style='border:dotted'>
            <div style='border:solid'>
                <p>paragraph 1</p>
                <p>paragraph 2</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </html>";
    // Set the new mode of import HTML block-level elements.
    auto insertOptions = HtmlInsertOptions::PreserveBlocks;
    auto builder = System::MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>();
    builder->InsertHtml(html, insertOptions);
    builder->get_Document()->Save(MyDir + u"sample.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public property ShadowFormat

Related issue: WORDSNET-23877

A new public ShadowFormat property has been added to ShapeBase class
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets shadow formatting for the shape.
    /// </summary>
    System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Drawing::ShadowFormat> get_ShadowFormat();
{{< /highlight >}}

With this property customers can set or get one of the preset shadow types.
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the specified <see cref="ShadowType"/> for ShadowFormat.
    /// </summary>
    Aspose::Words::Drawing::ShadowType get_Type();
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the specified <see cref="ShadowType"/> for ShadowFormat.
    /// </summary>
    void set_Type(Aspose::Words::Drawing::ShadowType value);
{{< /highlight >}}

Users can also get information about a shadow's visibility.
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns <c>true</c> if the formatting applied to this instance is visible.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Unlike <see cref="Clear()"/>, assigning <c>false</c> to Visible does not clear the formatting,
    /// it only hides the shape effect.
    /// </remarks>
    bool get_Visible();
{{< /highlight >}}

And it is also possible to clear ShadowFormat.
{{< highlight cpp >}}
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Clears shadow format.
    /// </summary>
    void Clear();
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    auto doc = System::MakeObject<Document>("DocumentWithShape.docx");
    auto shape = doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_Shapes()->idx_get(0);
    // Checking whether the shadow effect is visible and whether the preset type is Shadow2.
    if (shape->get_ShadowFormat()->get_Visible() && shape->get_ShadowFormat->get_ShapeType() == ShapeType::Shadow2)
    // Setting the preset shadow type to Shadow7.
    shape->get_ShadowFormat()->set_ShapeType(ShapeType::Shadow7);
    // Checking whether the shadow is customized, i.e. the preset type is ShadowMixed.
    if (shape->get_ShadowFormat()->get_ShapeType == ShapeType::ShadowMixed)
    // Clearing ShadowFormat.
    shape->get_ShadowFormat()->Clear();
{{< /highlight >}}

### ReportBuildOptions.RespectJpegExifOrientation enum member

Related issue: WORDSNET-23295

The following member has been added to the ReportBuildOptions enum:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies that the engine should use EXIF â€‹â€‹image orientation values to appropriately rotate inserted
    /// JPEG images.
    /// </summary>
    RespectJpegExifOrientation
{{< /highlight >}}

The option can be applied while building a report in the following way:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    auto engine = System::MakeObject<ReportingEngine>();
    engine->get_Options() |= ReportBuildOptions::RespectJpegExifOrientation;
    engine->BuildReport(...);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Supported the DATABASE field

Related issue: WORDSNET-15752

The following types and members have been added:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    class FieldOptions final
    {
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a provider that returns a query result for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field.
    /// </summary>
    const System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::IFieldDatabaseProvider>& get_FieldDatabaseProvider() const;
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a provider that returns a query result for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field.
    /// </summary>
    void set_FieldDatabaseProvider(const System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::IFieldDatabaseProvider>& value);
    }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Implement this interface to provide data for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field when it's updated.
    /// </summary>
    class IFieldDatabaseProvider
    {
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns query result.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="fileName">The complete path and file name of the database specified in the \d field switch.</param>
    /// <param name="connection">The connection to the data specified in the \c field switch.</param>
    /// <param name="query">The set of SQL instructions that query the database specified in the \s field switch.</param>
    /// <param name="field">The field being updated.</param>
    /// <returns>The <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataTable"/> instance that should be used for the field's update.</returns>
    virtual System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::FieldDatabaseDataTable> GetQueryResult(System::String fileName, System::String connection, System::String query, System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::FieldDatabase> field) = 0;
    }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides data for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field result.
    /// </summary>
    class FieldDatabaseDataTable
    {
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataTable"/> class.
    /// </summary>
    FieldDatabaseDataTable(const System::ArrayPtr<System::String>& columnNames);
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets columns that belong to this table.
    /// </summary>
    const System::ArrayPtr<System::String>& get_ColumnNames() const;
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets rows that belong to this table.
    /// </summary>
    const System::SharedPtr<System::Collections::Generic::IList<System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::FieldDatabaseDataRow>>>& get_Rows() const;
     
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataTable"/> class
    /// from the <see cref="System.Data.DataTable"/> instance.
    /// </summary>
    static System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::FieldDatabaseDataTable> CreateFrom(const System::SharedPtr<System::Data::DataTable>& dataTable);
    }
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides data for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field result.
    /// </summary>
    class FieldDatabaseDataRow
    {
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataRow"/> class.
    /// </summary>
    FieldDatabaseDataRow(const System::ArrayPtr<System::String>& values);
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets values that belong to this row.
    /// </summary>
    const System::ArrayPtr<System::String>& get_Values() const;
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataRow"/> class
    /// from the <see cref="System.Data.DataRow"/> instance.
    /// </summary>
    static System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::FieldDatabaseDataRow> CreateFrom(const System::SharedPtr<System::Data::DataRow>& dataRow);
    }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight cpp >}}

    document->get_FieldOptions()->set_FieldDatabaseProvider(System::MakeObject<OleDbFieldDatabaseProvider>());
    document->UpdateFields();

    class OleDbFieldDatabaseProvider : public IFieldDatabaseProvider
    {
        System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::FieldDatabaseDataTable> GetQueryResult(System::String fileName, System::String connection, System::String query, System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Fields::FieldDatabase> field) override
        {
            auto connectionStringBuilder = System::MakeObject<OleDbConnectionStringBuilder>(connection);
            connectionStringBuilder->set_DataSource(fileName);

            auto oleDbConnection = System::MakeObject<OleDbConnection>(connectionStringBuilder->ToString()))
            auto oleDbDataAdapter = System::MakeObject<OleDbDataAdapter>(query, oleDbConnection); 
            auto dataTable = System::MakeObject<DataTable>();
            oleDbDataAdapter->Fill(dataTable);

            return FieldDatabaseDataTable->CreateFrom(dataTable);
