## Major Features

This is a regular monthly release, we continue to add features from Aspose.Words for .Net.

## Limitations and API Differences

Aspose.Words for C++ has some differences as compared to its equivalent .NET version of the API. This section contains information about all such functionality that is not available in the current release.
The missing features will be added in future releases.

- The current release does not support some cryptography features - it cannot verify and sign documents.
- The current release does not support downloading remote resources from the Internet.
- The current release does not support the Metered license.
- The current release does not support a multipage TIFF format.
- The current release does not support LINQ and Reporting features.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.3. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new public property SaveOptions.UpdateLastPrintedProperty

Related issue: **WORDSNET-19776**

Added a new public property SaveOptions.UpdateLastPrintedProperty:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value determining whether the BuiltInDocumentProperties.LastPrinted property is updated before saving.
/// </summary>
public bool UpdateLastPrintedProperty
{{< /highlight >}}

It's true by default for FixedPageSaveOptions.

#### Use Case:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(docPath);
SaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
saveOptions.UpdateLastPrintedProperty = false;
doc.Save(pdfPath, saveOptions);
{{< /highlight >}}


### Added the ImageFieldMergingArgs.Shape property

Reference: **WORDSNET-19568**

A customer requested controlling various image properties when merging an image merge field, in particular, **WrapType**. Currently, it is only possible to set image width or height using the **ImageFieldMergingArgs.ImageWidth** and **ImageFieldMergingArgs.ImageHeight** properties, respectively.

We've opted for a more generic approach and decided to provide full control over the image (or any other shape) being inserted. We've introduced the **ImageFieldMergingArgs.Shape** property:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the shape that the mail merge engine must insert into the document.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>When this property is specified, the mail merge engine ignores all other properties like <see cref="ImageFileName"/> or <see cref="ImageStream"/>
/// and simply inserts the shape into the document.</p>
/// <p>Use this property to fully control the process of merging an image merge field.
/// For example, you can specify <see cref="ShapeBase.WrapType"/> or any other shape property to fine tune the resulting node. However, please note that
/// you are responsible for providing the content of the shape.</p>
/// </remarks>
public Shape Shape { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

As the summary states, this property overrides others like **ImageFileName** or **ImageStream**, i.e. the user just specifies a shape they want to insert with all necessary properties set:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
private class TestShapeSetFieldMergingCallback : IFieldMergingCallback
{
    void IFieldMergingCallback.FieldMerging(FieldMergingArgs args)
    {
        //  Implementation is not required.
    }
    void IFieldMergingCallback.ImageFieldMerging(ImageFieldMergingArgs args)
    {
        Shape shape = new Shape(args.Document);
        shape.Width = 1000;
        shape.Height = 2000;
        shape.WrapType = WrapType.Square;
        string imageFileName = "image.png";
        shape.ImageData.SetImage(imageFileName);
        args.Shape = shape;
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}


### FindReplaceOptions class is extended with new properties

Related issue: WORDSNET-19912.

The following public properties were added to FindReplaceOptions class:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a boolean value indicating either to ignore text inside delete revisions.
/// The default value is <c>false</c>.
/// </summary>
public bool IgnoreDeleted
{{< /highlight >}}

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a boolean value indicating either to ignore text inside insert revisions.
/// The default value is <c>false</c>.
/// </summary>
public bool IgnoreInserted
{{< /highlight >}}

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a boolean value indicating either to ignore text inside fields.
/// The default value is <c>false</c>.
/// </summary>
public bool IgnoreFields
{{< /highlight >}}


#### Use Case 1. Explains how to ignore text inside delete revisions:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Create new document.
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert non-revised text.
builder.Writeln("Deleted");
builder.Write("Text");

// Remove first paragraph with tracking revisions.
doc.StartTrackRevisions("author", DateTime.Now);
doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph.Remove();
doc.StopTrackRevisions();
Regex regex = new Regex("e");
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions();

// Replace 'e' in document ignoring deleted text.
options.IgnoreDeleted = true;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
 // The output is: Deleted\rT*xt\f

// Replace 'e' in document NOT ignoring deleted text.
options.IgnoreDeleted = false;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
 // The output is: D*l*t*d\rT*xt\f
{{< /highlight >}}


##### Use Case 2. Explains how to ignore text inside insert revisions:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Create new document.
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert text with tracking revisions.
doc.StartTrackRevisions("author", DateTime.Now);
builder.Writeln("Inserted");
doc.StopTrackRevisions();

// Insert non-revised text.
builder.Write("Text");
Regex regex = new Regex("e");
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions();

// Replace 'e' in document ignoring inserted text.
options.IgnoreInserted = true;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
 // The output is: Inserted\rT*xt\f

// Replace 'e' in document NOT ignoring inserted text.
options.IgnoreInserted = false;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
 // The output is: Ins*rt*d\rT*xt\f
{{< /highlight >}}


##### Use Case 3. Explains how to ignore text inside fields:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Create document.
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert field with text inside.
builder.InsertField("INCLUDETEXT", "Text in field");
Regex regex = new Regex("e");
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions();

// Replace 'e' in document ignoring text inside field.
options.IgnoreFields = true;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
 // The output is: \u0013INCLUDETEXT\u0014Text in field\u0015\f

// Replace 'e' in document NOT ignoring text inside field.
options.IgnoreFields = false;
doc.Range.Replace(regex, "*", options);
Console.WriteLine(doc.GetText());
 // The output is: \u0013INCLUDETEXT\u0014T*xt in fi*ld\u0015\f
{{< /highlight >}}
