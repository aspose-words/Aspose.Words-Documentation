The missing features will be added in future releases.

- The current release does not support some cryptography features - it cannot verify and sign documents.

- The current release does not support the Metered license.
- The current release does not support a multipage TIFF format.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.2. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### FieldMergingArgsBase.FieldValue made settable

Related issue: WORDSNET-19750

The customer was using the FieldMergingArgs.Text property and wanted the provided value to be formatted according to the format specified in the field being merged. We have made the FieldMergingArgsBase.FieldValue property settable so that instead of setting Text the user can set FieldValue which takes formatting into account instead of simply replacing the field.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the value of the field from the data source.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This property contains a value that has just been selected from your data source
/// for this field by the mail merge engine. You can also replace the value by setting the property.
/// </remarks>
public object FieldValue
{
    get { return mFieldValue; }
    set { mFieldValue = value; }
}

### Word 2019 version set by default

Ref: WORDSNET-19908

Due to the fact that submissions to the support service regarding different default spacing values for the paragraph have become more frequent, it was decided to change the default version of MS Word. Now, this version is MSWordVersion.Word2019. In most cases, the issue appeared when the customers created documents in WPS Office that do not write default spacing values for the paragraph in a document to be saved. When opening such documents in Aspose.Words, the values actual for MSWord 2007 were substituted because it was the default version before this release.

Now the code:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("document.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

will be identical to:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
LoadOptions lo = new LoadOptions();
lo.MswVersion = MsWordVersion.Word2019;
Document doc = new Document("document.docx", lo);
{{< /highlight >}}

To achieve the previous behavior, it is necessary to explicitly specify the version:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
LoadOptions lo = new LoadOptions();
lo.MswVersion = MsWordVersion.Word2007;
Document doc = new Document("document.docx", lo);
{{< /highlight >}}
