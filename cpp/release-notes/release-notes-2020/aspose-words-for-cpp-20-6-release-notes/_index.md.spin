## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new public class MarkdownSaveOptions

Related issue: WORDSNET-20297

A new public class **MarkdownSaveOptions** has been added into **Aspose.Words.Saving** namespace:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Class to specify additional options when saving a document into the <see cref="Words.SaveFormat.Markdown"/> format.

/// </summary>

public class MarkdownSaveOptions : TxtSaveOptionsBase

{{< /highlight >}}

For a moment it has only the following own public property:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Specifies the format in which the document will be saved if this save options object is used.

/// Can only be <see cref="Words.SaveFormat.Markdown"/>.

/// </summary>

public override SaveFormat SaveFormat

{{< /highlight >}}

Note, TxtSaveOptionsBase.PreserveTableLayout is moved to TxtSaveOptions.PreserveTableLayout:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Specifies whether the program should attempt to preserve layout of tables when saving in the plain text format.

/// The default value is <b>false</b>.

/// </summary>

public bool PreserveTableLayout

{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case. Explains how to create and use MarkdownSaveOptions object:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();

builder.Writeln("Some text!");



MarkdownSaveOptions saveOptions = (MarkdownSaveOptions)SaveOptions.CreateSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Markdown);

builder.Document.Save("TestDocument.md", saveOptions);

{{< /highlight >}}


### Added a new public property Font.EmphasisMark

Related issue: WORDSNET-13983

Added a new public property Font.EmphasisMark:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Gets or sets the emphasis mark applied to this formatting.

/// </summary>

public EmphasisMark EmphasisMark

{{< /highlight >}}


The emphasis mark is an additional character that is rendered above or below the main character glyph as specified in the enum below.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Specifies possible types of emphasis mark.

/// </summary>

public enum EmphasisMark

{

    /// <summary>

    /// No emphasis mark.

    /// </summary>

    None = 0x00,



    /// <summary>

    /// Emphasis mark is a solid black circle displayed above text.

    /// </summary>

    OverSolidCircle = 0x01,



    /// <summary>

    /// Emphasis mark is a comma character displayed above text.

    /// </summary>

    OverComma = 0x02,



    /// <summary>

    /// Emphasis mark is an empty white circle displayed above text.

    /// </summary>

    OverWhiteCircle = 0x03,



    /// <summary>

    /// Emphasis mark is a solid black circle displayed below text.

    /// </summary>

    UnderSolidCircle = 0x04,

}

{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case. Explains how to set Font.EmphasisMark via DocumentBuilder:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 Document document = new Document();

DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(document);



builder.Font.EmphasisMark = EmphasisMark.UnderSolidCircle;



builder.Write("Emphasis text");

builder.Writeln();

builder.Font.ClearFormatting();

builder.Write("Simple text");



document.Save(savePath, saveOptions);

{{< /highlight >}}


### Added a new public property ImportFormatOptions.IgnoreHeaderFooter

Related issue: WORDSNET-19776

Added a new public property ImportFormatOptions.IgnoreHeaderFooter:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Gets or sets a boolean value that specifies that source formatting of headers/footers content ignored

/// if ImportFormatMode.KeepSourceFormatting mode is used.

/// The default value is true.

/// </summary>

{{< /highlight >}}

It's true by default to preserve Word's behavior.

Use Case:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 Document dstDocument = new Document(dstDocumentPath);

Document srcDocument = new Document(srcDocumentPath);



ImportFormatOptions importFormatOptions = new ImportFormatOptions();

importFormatOptions.IgnoreHeaderFooter = false;



dstDocument.AppendDocument(srcDocument, ImportFormatMode.KeepSourceFormatting, importFormatOptions);

{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new public property MarkdownSaveOptions.TableContentAlignment

Related issue: WORDSNET-20425

A new public property **TableContentAlignment** has been added into **MarkdownSaveOptions** class:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Gets or sets a value that specifies how to align contents in tables

/// when exporting into the <see cref="Words.SaveFormat.Markdown"/> format.

/// The default value is <see cref="Saving.TableContentAlignment.Auto"/>. 

/// </summary>

public TableContentAlignment TableContentAlignment { get; set; }

{{< /highlight >}}

Also, a new public enumeration has been added:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Allows to specify the alignment of the content of the table to be used when exporting into Markdown format.

/// </summary>

public enum TableContentAlignment

{

    /// <summary>

    /// The alignment will be taken from the first paragraph in corresponding table column.

    /// </summary>

    Auto,

    /// <summary>

    /// The content of tables will be aligned to the Left.

    /// </summary>

    Left,

    /// <summary>

    /// The content of tables will be aligned to the Center.

    /// </summary>

    Center,

    /// <summary>

    /// The content of tables will be aligned to the Right.

    /// </summary>

    Right

}

{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case. Explains how to align content inside the table when exporting into Markdown:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();



// Create a new table with two cells.

builder.InsertCell();

builder.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Right;

builder.Write("Cell1");

builder.InsertCell();

builder.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center;

builder.Write("Cell2");



MarkdownSaveOptions saveOptions = new MarkdownSaveOptions();

// Makes all paragraphs inside table to be aligned to Left. 

saveOptions.TableContentAlignment = TableContentAlignment.Left;

builder.Document.Save("left.md", saveOptions);



// Makes all paragraphs inside table to be aligned to Right. 

saveOptions.TableContentAlignment = TableContentAlignment.Right;

builder.Document.Save("right.md", saveOptions);



// Makes all paragraphs inside table to be aligned to Center. 

saveOptions.TableContentAlignment = TableContentAlignment.Center;

builder.Document.Save("center.md", saveOptions);



// Makes all paragraphs inside table to be aligned automatically.

// The alignment in this case will be taken from the first paragraph in corresponding table column.

saveOptions.TableContentAlignment = TableContentAlignment.Auto;

builder.Document.Save("auto.md", saveOptions);

{{< /highlight >}}

### PDF version 1.5 is marked as obsolete

PDF version 1.5 is outdated and marked as obsolete. Please, use the latest PDF version 1.7.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 // Specifies the PDF standards compliance level. 

public enum PdfCompliance

{

...

    [Obsolete("PDF version 1.5 is outdated and will be removed in future releases. Please, use the latest PDF version 1.7.")]

    Pdf15,

...

}

{{< /highlight >}}
