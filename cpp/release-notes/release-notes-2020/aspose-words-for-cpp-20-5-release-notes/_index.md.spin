## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new public property OoxmlSaveOptions.CompressionLevel

Related issue: WORDSNET-20169

A new public option has been added to the 'OoxmlSaveOptions' class:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the compression level used to save document.
/// </summary>
public CompressionLevel CompressionLevel
{{< /highlight >}}

The corresponding public 'CompressionLevel' enum has been added to the 'Aspose.Words.Saving' namespace:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// The compression level for OOXML files. 
/// <para>
/// (DOCX and DOTX files are internally a ZIP-archive, this property controls the compression level of the archive.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Note, that FlatOpc file is not a ZIP-archive, therefore, this property does not affect the FlatOpc files.)
/// </para>
/// </summary>
public enum CompressionLevel
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Normal compression level. Default compression level used by Aspose.Words.
    /// </summary>
    Normal = 0,
    /// <summary>
    /// Maximum compression level.
    /// </summary>
    Maximum = 1,
    /// <summary>
    /// Fast compression level.
    /// </summary>
    Fast = 2,
    /// <summary>
    /// Super Fast compression level. Microsoft Word uses this compression level.
    /// </summary>
    SuperFast = 3
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to specify the compression level 'SuperFast' (used by Microsoft Word) to save the document.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("in.docx");
OoxmlSaveOptions so = new OoxmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Docx);
so.CompressionLevel = CompressionLevel.SuperFast;
doc.Save("out.docx", so);
{{< /highlight >}}


### Added page layout callback

Related issue WORDSNET-19093

Document.LayoutOptions.Callback property

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets <see cref="IPageLayoutCallback"/> implementation used by page layout model.
/// </summary>
public IPageLayoutCallback Callback
{{< /highlight >}}

An interface implemented by application:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public interface IPageLayoutCallback
{
    /// <summary>
    /// This is called to notify of layout build and rendering progress.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Exception when thrown by implementation aborts layout build process.<para />
    /// </remarks>

public class PageLayoutCallbackArgs
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets event.
    /// </summary>
    public PageLayoutEvent Event { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets document.
    /// </summary>
    public Document Document
    {
        get { return _Document; }
    }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets 0-based index of the page in the document this event relates to.
    /// Returns negative value if there is no associated page, or if page was removed during reflow.
    /// </summary>
    public int PageIndex
    {
        get { return Part != null ? Part.GetPage().GetIndex() : -1; }
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Event codes

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public enum PageLayoutEvent
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Default value
    /// </summary>
    None,

    /// While inside <see cref="IPageLayoutCallback.Notify(PageLayoutCallbackArgs)"/> throw custom exception to abort process.<para/>
    /// You can throw when handling any callback event to abort process.<para/>
    /// Note that if process is aborted the page layout model remains in undefined state. If process is aborted upon reflow of a complete page,
    /// however, it should be possible to use layout model up to the end of that page.<para/>
    /// </summary>
    WatchDog,
    /// <summary>
    /// Build of the page layout has started. Fired once.
    /// This is the first event which occurs when <see cref="Document.UpdatePageLayout"/> is called.
    /// </summary>
    BuildStarted,
    /// <summary>
    /// Build of the page layout has finished. Fired once.
    /// This is the last event which occurs when <see cref="Document.UpdatePageLayout"/> is called.
    /// </summary>
    BuildFinished,
    /// <summary>
    /// Conversion of document model to page layout has started. Fired once.

    /// <seealso cref="PageLayoutCallbackArgs.PageIndex"/>
    /// </summary>
    PartReflowStarted,
    /// <summary>
    /// Reflow of the page has finished.
    /// Note that page may reflow multiple times and that reflow may restart before it is finished.
    /// <seealso cref="PageLayoutCallbackArgs.PageIndex"/>
    /// </summary>
    PartReflowFinished,
    /// <summary>
    /// Rendering of page has started. This is fired once per page.
    /// </summary>
    PartRenderingStarted,
    /// <summary>

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(fileName);
CleanupOptions options = new CleanupOptions();
options.DuplicateStyle = true;
doc.Cleanup(options);
doc.Save(outFileName);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added а new public method FontInfo.GetEmbeddedFontAsOpenType()

Related issue: WORDSNET-20249

A new method GetEmbeddedFontAsOpenType() has been added to FontInfo class. It allows to convert embedded fonts in Embedded OpenType format (which comes from .doc documents) to OpenType.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets an embedded font file in OpenType format. Fonts in Embedded OpenType format are converted to OpenType.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="style">Specifies the font style to retrieve.</param>
/// <returns>Returns <c>null</c> if the specified font is not embedded.</returns>
public byte[] GetEmbeddedFontAsOpenType(EmbeddedFontStyle style)
{{< /highlight >}}

### New helper class to work with Watermark inside document was introduced

Related issue: WORDSNET-4879.

The new property Watermark has been added to the Document class.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Provides access to the document watermark.
/// </summary>
public Watermark Watermark { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

The new Watermark class allows adding/removing the watermark from the document. A watermark can be created from a text or from an image.

**.NET**

{
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds Text watermark into the document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="text">Text that displays as a watermark.</param>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The text length should be in the range from 1 to 200 inclusive.
    /// The text cannot be null or consist only of whitespaces.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentOutOfRangeException">
    /// Throws when the text length is out of range or the text consists only of whitespaces.
    /// </exception>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">
    /// Throws when the text is null.
    /// </exception>
    public void SetText(string text)
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds Text watermark into the document.

    /// The text cannot be null or consist only of whitespaces.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentOutOfRangeException">
    /// Throws when the text length is out of range or the text consists only of whitespaces.
    /// </exception>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">
    /// Throws when the text is null.
    /// </exception>
    /// <remarks>If options is null, the watermark will be set with default properties.</remarks>
    public void SetText(string text, TextWatermarkOptions options)
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds Image watermark into the document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="image">Image that displays as a watermark.</param>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">
    /// Throws when the image is null.
    /// </exception>
    public void SetImage(Image image)
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds Image watermark into the document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="image">Image that displays as a watermark.</param>
    /// <param name="options">Defines additional options for the image watermark.</param>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">
    /// Throws when the image is null.
    /// </exception>
    /// <remarks>If options is null, the watermark will be set with default properties.</remarks>
    public void SetImage(Image image, ImageWatermarkOptions options)
    /// <summary>
    /// Removes watermark.
    /// </summary>
    public void Remove()
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns watermark type.
    /// </summary>
    public WatermarkType Type { get; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The new enum is provided to determine the type of watermark inside the document.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the watermark type.
/// </summary>
public enum WatermarkType
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Indicates that the text will be used as a watermark.
    /// <p>Such a watermark corresponds to a WordArt object.</p>
    /// </summary>
    Text,
    /// <summary>
    /// Indicates that the image will be used as a watermark.
    /// <p>Such a watermark corresponds to a shape with image.</p>
    /// </summary>
    Image,
    /// <summary>
    /// Indicates watermark is no set.
    /// </summary>
    None
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The following option classes are provided to customize the watermark.

For Text watermark.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Contains options that can be specified when adding a watermark with text.
/// </summary>
public class TextWatermarkOptions
{

    /// Gets or sets font family name. The default value is "Calibri".
    /// </summary>
    public string FontFamily { get; set; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets font color. The default value is Color.Silver.
    /// </summary>
    public Color Color { get; set; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a font size. The default value is 0 - auto.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <p>Valid values range from 0 to 65.5 inclusive.</p>
    /// <p> Auto font size means that the watermark will be scaled to its max width and max height relative to
    /// the page margins.</p>
    /// </remarks>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentOutOfRangeException">
    /// Throws when argument was out of the range of valid values.
    /// </exception>
    public float FontSize { get; set; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a boolean value which is responsible for opacity of the watermark.
    /// The default value is <code>true</code>.
    /// </summary>
    public bool IsSemitrasparent { get; set; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets layout of the watermark. The default value is <see cref="WatermarkLayout.Diagonal"/>.
    /// </summary>
    public WatermarkLayout Layout { get; set; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The new enum is provided to set the text watermark in a diagonal or horizontal layout.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Defines layout of the watermark relative to the watermark center.
/// </summary>
public enum WatermarkLayout
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Horizontal watermark layout. Corresponds to 0 degrees of rotation.
    /// </summary>
    Horizontal = 0,
    /// <summary>
    /// Diagonal watermark layout. Corresponds to 315 degrees of rotation.
    /// </summary>
    Diagonal = 315
}
{{< /highlight >}}

For Image watermark:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Contains options that can be specified when adding a watermark with image.
/// </summary>
public class ImageWatermarkOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the scale factor expressed as a fraction of the image. The default value is 0 - auto.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <p>Valid values range from 0 to 65.5 inclusive.</p>
    /// <p>Auto scale means that the watermark will be scaled to its max width and max height relative to
    /// the page margins.</p>
    /// </remarks>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentOutOfRangeException">
    /// Throws when argument was out of the range of valid values.
    /// </exception>
    public double Scale { get; set; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a boolean value which is responsible for washout effect of the watermark.
    /// The default value is <code>true</code>.
    /// </summary>
    public bool IsWashout { get; set; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Use Case: Add Text watermark with specific options.

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(pathFile);
TextWatermarkOptions options = new TextWatermarkOptions()
{
    FontFamily = "Arial",
    FontSize = 36,
    Color = Color.Black,
    Layout = WatermarkLayout.Horizontal,
    IsSemitrasparent = false
