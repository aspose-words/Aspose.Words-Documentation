## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 21.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Moved public C++ header files according to namespace names

Related issue: WORDSCPP-1076

Starting with this release, the public C++ header files are located according to the namespace names. i.e. `Aspose::Words::Document` is now located in `Aspose.Words.Cpp/Document.h` instead of `Aspose.Words.Cpp/Model/Document/Document.h`. Headers on the old paths are still available and redirect to the new paths.

### Added advanced typography support with HarfBuzz

Related issue: WORDSCPP-793

We have enabled advanced typography support. We have prepared Aspose.Words.Shaping.HarfBuzz package. This package uses HarfBuzz text shaping engine to perform text shaping.

Usage example:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
    // Open a document
    auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"OpenType.Document.docx");

    // When text shaper factory is set, layout starts to use OpenType features.
    // An Instance property returns static BasicTextShaperCache object wrapping HarfBuzzTextShaperFactory
    doc->get_LayoutOptions()->set_TextShaperFactory(HarfBuzzTextShaperFactory::get_Instance());

    // Render the document to PDF format
    doc->Save(u"OpenType.Document.pdf");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new value to public enumeration StyleIdentifier

Related issue: WORDSNET-21757

A new value is added to the public enumeration StyleIdentifier:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// The Smart Link style.
/// </summary>
SmartLink = 371
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use StyleIdentifier.SmartLink enumeration value.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>();
auto normalStyle = builder->get_Document()->get_Styles()->idx_get(StyleIdentifier::Normal);
auto smartLinkStyle = builder->get_Document()->get_Styles()->idx_get(StyleIdentifier::SmartLink);
smartLinkStyle->get_Font()->set_Size(normalStyle->get_Font()->get_Size());
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added MailMerge.RestartListsAtEachSection property to control list numbering restart

Related issue: WORDSNET-22032

We have implemented the MailMerge.RestartListsAtEachSection property to control whether or not list numbering is restarted at each section when mail merge is performed. 
It is true by default to mimic Word behaviour, but can be set to false if the customer wants continuous numbering.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value indicating whether lists are restarted at each section after executing of a mail merge.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The default value is <b>true</b>.
/// </remarks>
public bool RestartListsAtEachSection { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto document = MakeObject<Document>();
document->get_Lists()->Add(ListTemplate::NumberDefault);
document->get_Lists()->Add(ListTemplate::OutlineNumbers);
document->get_Lists()->Add(ListTemplate::BulletDefault);
 
document->get_MailMerge()->set_RestartListsAtEachSection(false);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new members to ShapeType enum

Related issue: WORDSNET-20197

The following new members have been added to the ShapeType enum. The members are applicable only for DML shapes.

{{< highlight csharp >}}

### Added new public methods StructuredDocumentTag.SetCheckedSymbol() and StructuredDocumentTag.SetUncheckedSymbol()

Related issue: WORDSNET-21818

New public methods SetCheckedSymbol() and SetUncheckedSymbol() have been added to the StructuredDocumentTag class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Sets the symbol used to represent the checked state of a check box content control.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="characterCode">The character code for the specified symbol.</param>
/// <param name="fontName">The name of the font that contains the symbol.</param>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Accessing this method will only work for <see cref="Markup.SdtType.Checkbox"/> SDT types.</para>
/// <para>For all other SDT types exception will occur.</para>
/// </remarks>
public void SetCheckedSymbol(int characterCode, string fontName);
/// <summary>
/// Sets the symbol used to represent the unchecked state of a check box content control.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="characterCode">The character code for the specified symbol.</param>
/// <param name="fontName">The name of the font that contains the symbol.</param>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Accessing this method will only work for <see cref="Markup.SdtType.Checkbox"/> SDT types.</para>
/// <para>For all other SDT types exception will occur.</para>
/// </remarks>
public void SetUncheckedSymbol(int characterCode, string fontName);
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to set the checked and unchecked symbols for the SDT of the 'SdtType.Checkbox' type.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto tag = MakeObject<StructuredDocumentTag>(doc, SdtType::Checkbox, MarkupLevel::Block);
doc->get_Sections()->idx_get(0)->get_Body()->AppendChild(tag);
tag->SetCheckedSymbol(0x00A9, u"Times New Roman");
tag->SetUncheckedSymbol(0x00AE, u"Times New Roman");
doc->Save(u"output.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public property Document.LayoutOptions.CommentDisplayMode

Related issue: WORDSNET-21645

Added the ability to use PDF annotations to display user comments. 
The comment display mode is now set via the Document.LayoutOptions.CommentDisplayMode property:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the way comments are rendered.
/// Default value is <see cref="CommentDisplayMode.ShowInBalloons"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Note that revisions are not rendered in balloons for <see cref="CommentDisplayMode .ShowInAnnotations"/>.
/// </remarks>
public CommentDisplayMode CommentDisplayMode
{{< /highlight >}}

Document.LayoutOptions.ShowComments property was marked as obsolete:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets indication of whether comments are rendered.
/// Default is True.
/// This property is obsolete. Use <see cref="LayoutOptions.CommentDisplayMode"/> property instead.
/// </summary>
[Obsolete("This property is obsolete. Use CommentDisplayMode property instead.")]
public bool ShowComments
 
// False == CommentDisplayMode.Hide
// True == CommentDisplayMode.ShowInBalloons
{{< /highlight >}}

The following comment display modes are now available:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the rendering mode for document comments.
/// </summary>
public enum CommentDisplayMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// No document comments are rendered.
    /// </summary>
    Hide,
    /// <summary>
    /// Renders document comments in balloons in the margin. This is the default value.
    /// </summary>
    ShowInBalloons,
    /// <summary>
    /// Renders document comments in annotations. This is only available for Pdf format.
    /// </summary>
    ShowInAnnotations
}
{{< /highlight >}}

CommentDisplayMode.ShowInAnnotations is only available in Pdf1.7 and Pdf1.5 for user comments (revisions are not supported). 
In other formats ShowInAnnotations will work similar to Hide.

Note: It is required to rebuild the document page layout (via Document.UpdatePageLayout() method) after changing the Document.LayoutOptions values.

Use Case: Explains how to set CommentDisplayMode.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"input.docx");
doc->get_LayoutOptions()->set_CommentDisplayMode(CommentDisplayMode::ShowInAnnotations);
doc->Save(u"output.pdf");
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"input.docx");
doc->get_LayoutOptions()->set_CommentDisplayMode(CommentDisplayMode::ShowInAnnotations);
doc->Save(u"output-pdf.pdf"); // This is a new way to display comments available for Pdf(not supported for Pdf/A).
doc->Save(u"output-xps.xps"); // When saving to any other format, it works in the same way as CommentDisplayMode.Hide.
 
doc->get_LayoutOptions()->set_CommentDisplayMode(CommentDisplayMode::Hide);
doc->UpdatePageLayout();
doc->Save(u"output-hide.pdf"); //This is similar to the obsolete option ShowComments=false
 
doc->get_LayoutOptions()->set_CommentDisplayMode(CommentDisplayMode::ShowInBalloons);
doc->UpdatePageLayout();
doc->Save(u"output-balloon.pdf"); //This is similar to the obsolete option ShowComments=true
{{< /highlight >}}
