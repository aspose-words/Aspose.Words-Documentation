Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Aspose::Wordsx::Comparing namespace was introduced

Due to refactoring work on Aspose.Words namespaces, CompareOptions, ComparisonTargetType, Granularity classes were moved to new separate namespace Aspose::Words::Comparing.
In case of compilation error - please add `using namespace Aspose::Words::Comparing` and fix corresponding include directives - please check API Reference Documentation for a correct include paths.

### Aspose::Words::Notes namespace was introduced

### The classes related to load options were moved to Aspose::Words::Loading namespace

Due to refactoring work on Aspose.Words namespaces, LoadOptions, PdfLoadOptions, RtfLoadOptions, TxtLoadOptions classes and corresponding enums were moved to Aspose.Words.Loading namespace.
In case of compilation error - please add `using namespace Aspose::Words::Loading` and fix corresponding include directives - please check API Reference Documentation for a correct include paths.

### Added a new public property CleanupOptions.UnusedBuiltinStyles

Related issue: WORDSNET-21977

Added a new public property to CleanupOptions:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies that unused BuiltIn styles should be removed from document.
/// </summary>
public bool UnusedBuiltinStyles { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use UnusedBuiltinStyles property.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"input.docx");
auto cleanupOptions = MakeObject<CleanupOptions>();
cleanupOptions->set_UnusedBuiltinStyles(true);
doc->Cleanup(cleanupOptions);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Fill::Solid() method was introduced

Related issue: WORDSNET-21808

The following new public methods were added into the Fill class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Sets the fill to a uniform color.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use this method to convert any of the fills back to solid fill.
/// </remarks>
public void Solid()
 
/// <summary>
/// Sets the fill to a specified uniform color.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use this method to convert any of the fills back to solid fill.
/// </remarks>
public void Solid(Color color)
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to change fill to Solid.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
// Open some document with text effects.
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"TextTwoColorGradient.docx");
 
// Get Fill object for Font of the first Run.
auto fill = doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_FirstParagraph()->get_Runs()->idx_get(0)->get_Font()->get_Fill();
 
// Check Fill properties of the Font.
std::cout << "The type of the fill is: " << System::ObjectExt::ToString(fill->get_FillType()).ToUtf8String() << '\n';
std::cout << "The foreground color of the fill is: " << fill->get_ForeColor()->ToString().ToUtf8String() << '\n';
std::cout << "The fill is transparent at " << fill->get_Transparency() * 100 << "%\n\n";
 
// Change type of the fill to Solid with uniform green color.
fill->Solid(Color::get_Green());
std::cout << "The fill is changed:\n";
std::cout << "The type of the fill is: " << System::ObjectExt::ToString(fill->get_FillType()).ToUtf8String() << '\n';
std::cout << "The foreground color of the fill is: " << fill->get_ForeColor()->ToString().ToUtf8String() << '\n';
std::cout << "The fill is transparent at " << fill->get_Transparency() * 100 << "%\n";
 
doc.Save("TextSolidOut.docx");
 
/*
This code example produces the following results:
 
The type of the fill is: Gradient
The foreground color of the fill is: Color [A=255, R=0, G=128, B=128]
The fill is transparent at 65%
 
The fill is changed:
The type of the fill is: Solid
The foreground color of the fill is: Color [A=255, R=0, G=128, B=0]
The fill transparency is 0%

### Public API of Structured Document Tag range was extended

Related issue: WORDSNET-21246

The constructors for StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart and StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd classes have been made public. Now the instances of these classes can be created manually.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of the <b>Structured document tag range start</b> class.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>The following types of SDT can be created:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Checkbox"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.DropDownList"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.ComboBox"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Date"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.BuildingBlockGallery"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Group"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Picture"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.RichText"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.PlainText"/></item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="doc">The owner document.</param>
/// <param name="type">Type of SDT node.</param>
public StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart(DocumentBase doc, SdtType type)
 
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of the <b>Structured document tag range end</b> class.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="doc">The owner document.</param>
/// <param name="id">Identifier of the corresponding structured document tag range start.</param>
public StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd(DocumentBase doc, int id)
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"input.docx");
 
auto start = MakeObject<StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart>(doc, SdtType::RepeatingSectionItem);
auto end = MakeObject<StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd>(doc, start->get_Id());
 
doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->InsertAfter(start, doc->get_FirstSection->get_Body()->get_FirstParagraph());
doc->get_LastSection()->get_Body()->InsertBefore(end, doc->get_LastSection()->get_Body()->get_LastParagraph());
 
doc->Save(u"output.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

A new public RemoveAllChildren() method has been added.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Removes all the nodes between this range start node and the range end node.
/// </summary>
public void RemoveAllChildren()
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use RemoveAllChildren() method.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"input.docx");
 
int32_t nodeCountBefore = doc->GetChildNodes(NodeType::Any, true)->get_Count();
auto start = System::StaticCast<StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart>(doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->GetChild(NodeType::StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart, 0, false));
start->RemoveAllChildren();
 
int32_t nodeCountAfter = doc->GetChildNodes(NodeType::Any, true)->get_Count();

std::cout << nodeCountBefore << '\n' << nodeCountAfter << '\n';
{{< /highlight >}}

A new public RemoveSelfOnly() method has been added.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Removes this range start and appropriate range end nodes of the structured document tag,
/// but keeps its content inside the document tree.
/// </summary>
public void RemoveSelfOnly()
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use RemoveSelfOnly() method.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(u"input.docx");
auto start = System::StaticCast<StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart>(doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->GetChild(NodeType::StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart, 0, false));
start->RemoveSelfOnly();
{{< /highlight >}}

### Removed obsolete PdfSaveOptions.EscapeUri property

This option is not needed anymore because writing of URI to PDF was improved and cases when disabled escaping was required are handled well now.
