## Major Features

We have added the following features from Aspose.Words for .Net on this regular monthly release:

- StartColumnBookmark and EndColumnBookmark methods were introduced in DocumentBuilder class.
- MarkdownSaveOptions.ImageSavingCallback has been added to control how images are saved upon converting to Markdown format.
- Added an ability to ignore &lt;noscript&gt; HTML elements upon loading HTML.
- TableStyle.VerticalAlignment was exposed publicly.

## Limitations and API Differences

Aspose.Words for C++ has some differences as compared to its equivalent .NET version of the API. This section contains information about all such functionality that is not available in the current release.
The missing features will be added in future releases.

- The current release does not support cryptography features - it cannot verify, sign, encrypt or decrypt documents.
- The current release does not support downloading remote resources from the Internet.
- The current release does not support Metered license.
- The current release does not support a multipage TIFF format.
- The current release does not support LINQ and Reporting features.
- The current release has limited support for database features - C++ does not have common API for DB like .Net System.Data.
- The current release only supports Microsoft Visual C++ version 2015 or higher and only for the x64 platform.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 21.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.


### Added a new public property HtmlLoadOptions::IgnoreNoscriptElements

Related issue: WORDSNET-21203

Added a new public property HtmlLoadOptions::IgnoreNoscriptElements:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets a value indicating whether to ignore &lt;noscript&gt; HTML elements.
/// Default value is <c>false</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Like MS Word, Aspose.Words does not support scripts and by default loads content of &lt;noscript&gt; elements
/// into the resulting document. In most browsers, however, scripts are supported and content from &lt;noscript&gt;
/// is not visible. Setting this property to <c>true</c> forces Aspose.Words to ignore all &lt;noscript&gt; elements
/// and helps to produce documents that look closer to what is seen in browsers.
/// </remarks>
bool get_IgnoreNoscriptElements() const;

/// Setter for HtmlLoadOptions::IgnoreNoscriptElements
void set_IgnoreNoscriptElements(bool value);
{{< /highlight >}}

Customers may now instruct Aspose.Words to ignore &lt;noscript&gt; HTML elements like most modern browsers do.

Use Case:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto loadOptions = MakeObject<HtmlLoadOptions>();
loadOptions->set_IgnoreNoscriptElements(true);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new public property Node::CustomNodeId

Related issue: WORDSNET-21203

Added a new public property Node::CustomNodeId:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies custom node identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Default is zero.</p>
/// <p>This identifier can be set and used arbitrarily. For example, as a key to get external data.</p>
/// </remarks>
void int32_t get_CustomNodeId() const;
void void set_CustomNodeId(int32_t value);
{{< /highlight >}}

Customers now may track node position in the model tree and bind external data based on assigned identifier:

Use Case: 

{{< highlight csharp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);
auto shape = builder->InsertShape(ShapeType::Rectangle, 100, 100);
shape->set_CustomNodeId(100);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new public property TableStyle::VerticalAlignment

Related issue: WORDSNET-21114

Added a new public options that allows to set table style cell vertical alignment.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the vertical alignment for the cells.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The default value is <see cref="CellVerticalAlignment::Top"/>.
/// </remarks>
CellVerticalAlignment get_VerticalAlignment() const;
void set_VerticalAlignment(CellVerticalAlignment value);
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: 

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(filename);
auto style = StaticCast<TableStyle>(doc->get_Styles()->idx_get(u"Custom Table 1"));
style->set_VerticalAlignment(CellVerticalAlignment::Center);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public methods StartColumnBookmark and EndColumnBookmark to DocumentBuilder class

Related issue: WORDSNET-18882

The following public methods have been added to the DocumentBuilder class:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Marks the current position in the document as a column bookmark start. The position must be in a table cell.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>A column bookmark covers one or more columns in a range of rows. To create a valid bookmark you
/// need to call both <see cref="StartColumnBookmark"/> and <see cref="EndColumnBookmark"/> with the same
/// <b>bookmarkName</b> parameter.</p>
/// <p>Badly formed bookmarks or bookmarks with duplicate names will be ignored when the document is saved.</p>
/// <p>The actual position of the inserted <see cref="BookmarkStart"/> node may differ from the current document
/// builder position.</p>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="bookmarkName">Name of the bookmark.</param>
/// <returns>The bookmark start node that was just created.</returns>
SharedPtr<BookmarkStart> StartColumnBookmark(System::String bookmarkName);
 
/// <summary>
/// Marks the current position in the document as a column bookmark end. The position must be in a table cell.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>A column bookmark covers one or more columns in a range of rows. To create a valid bookmark you
/// need to call both <see cref="StartColumnBookmark"/> and <see cref="EndColumnBookmark"/> with the same
/// <b>bookmarkName</b> parameter.</p>
/// <p>Badly formed bookmarks or bookmarks with duplicate names will be ignored when the document is saved.</p>
/// <p>The actual position of the inserted <see cref="BookmarkEnd"/> node may differ from the current document
/// builder position.</p>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="bookmarkName">Name of the bookmark.</param>
/// <returns>The bookmark end node that was just created.</returns>
SharedPtr<BookmarkEnd> EndColumnBookmark(System::String bookmarkName);
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: 

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);
 
builder->StartTable();
 
builder->InsertCell();
builder->StartColumnBookmark(u"Bookmark1");
builder->Write(u"Cell 1");
 
builder->InsertCell();
builder->Write(u"Cell 2");
 
builder->InsertCell();
builder->Write(u"Cell 3");
 
builder->EndRow();
 
builder->InsertCell();
builder->Write(u"Cell 4");
 
builder->InsertCell();
builder->Write(u"Cell 5");
builder->EndColumnBookmark(u"Bookmark1");
 
builder->InsertCell();
builder->Write(u"Cell 6");
 
builder->EndRow();
builder->EndTable();
 
doc->Save(u"out.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### MarkdownSaveOptions::ImageSavingCallback has been added to control how images are saved upon converting to Markdown format

Related issue: WORDSNET-21389

A new public property ImageSavingCallback has been added to the MarkdownSaveOptions class:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to control how images are saved when a document is saved to <see cref="SaveFormat::Markdown"/> format.
/// </summary>
SharedPtr<IImageSavingCallback> get_ImageSavingCallback() const;
void set_ImageSavingCallback(SharedPtr<IImageSavingCallback> value);
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: 

{{< highlight cpp >}}

class SavedImageRename;

void HandleDocument()
{
    String outFileName = u"SavingCallback.DocumentParts.Rendering.md";
 
    // Open a document to be converted to Markdown.
    auto doc = MakeObject<Document>("Rendering.docx");
 
    // We can use an appropriate SaveOptions subclass to customize the conversion process.
    auto options = MakeObject<MarkdownSaveOptions>();
 
    // If we convert a document that contains images into Markdown, we will end up with one Markdown file which links to several images.
    // Each image will be in the form of a file in the local file system.
    // There is also a callback that can customize the name and file system location of each image.
    options->set_ImageSavingCallback(MakeObject<SavedImageRename>(outFileName));
 
    // The ImageSaving() method of our callback will be run at this time.
    doc->Save(outFileName, options);
}

/// <summary>
/// Renames saved images that are produced when an Markdown document is saved.
/// </summary>
class SavedImageRename : public IImageSavingCallback
{
public:
    SavedImageRename(String outFileName) : mOutFileName(outFileName) {}
 
    void ImageSaving(SharedPtr<ImageSavingArgs> args) override
    {
        mCount++;
        String imageFileName = String::Format(u"{0} shape {1}, of type {2}{3}",
          mOutFileName, mCount, ObjectExt::ToString(args->get_CurrentShape()->get_ShapeType()),
          Path::GetExtension(args->get_ImageFileName());
 
        args->set_ImageFileName(imageFileName);
        args->set_ImageStream(MakeObject<FileStream>(imageFileName, FileMode::Create));
    }
 
private:
    int32_t mCount = 0;
    String mOutFileName;
};
{{< /highlight >}}

### PdfSaveOptions::EscapeUri is marked as obsolete

We made several improvements in export of hyperlinks to PDF per WORDSNET-21443. Now the cases when setting PdfSaveOptions:;EscapeUri to false was required (improper unescaping of explicitly escaped URI delimiter chars) are handled well by default. Thus we do not see a reason to keep this option longer and marked it as obsolete.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// <summary>
/// A flag specifying whether URI should be escaped before writing.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Note that if this option is set to <c>false</c> hyperlinks are written "as is",
/// so valid (escaped) URI should be provided in document's model.
/// <para>The default value is <c>true</c>.</para>
/// </remarks>
[[deprecated("Writing of URI to PDF was improved and cases when disabled escaping was required are handled well now.")]]
bool get_EscapeUri() const;

[[deprecated("Writing of URI to PDF was improved and cases when disabled escaping was required are handled well now.")]]
void set_EscapeUri(bool value);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Removed obsolete properties FixedPageSaveOptions::PageIndex, FixedPageSaveOptions::PageCount, ImageSaveOptions::PageIndex, ImageSaveOptions::PageCount

Related issue: WORDSNET-21154

Deprecated properties related to page specification when printing were removed from the FixedPageSaveOptions and ImageSaveOptions classes.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
[[deprecated("This property is obsolete. Please use PageSet property instead.")]]
int32_t get_PageCount() const;
[[deprecated("This property is obsolete. Please use PageSet property instead.")]]
void set_PageCount(int32_t value);

[[deprecated("This property is obsolete. Please use PageSet property instead.")]]
int32_t get_PageIndex() const;
[[deprecated("This property is obsolete. Please use PageSet property instead.")]]
void set_PageIndex(int32_t value);
{{< /highlight >}}

### The behavior of DocumentBuilder::InsertOleObject() and DocumentBuilder:;InsertOleObjectAsIcon() methods was changed

Related issue: WORDSNET-21426

In cases where the DocumentBuilder::InsertOleObject() and DocumentBuilder::InsertOleObjectAsIcon() methods need to create an icon with a caption, they can use the file extension to define the icon, and can use the filename for the icon caption.

More details:
{{< highlight cpp >}}
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObject(SharedPtr<Stream> stream, String progId, bool asIcon, SharedPtr<Stream> presentation)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'presentation' is omitted and 'asIcon' is set, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the predefined icon caption.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObject(String fileName, bool isLinked, bool asIcon, SharedPtr<Stream> presentation)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'presentation' is omitted and 'asIcon' is set, this overloaded method selects the icon according to the file extension and uses the filename for the icon caption.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObject(String fileName, String progId, bool isLinked, bool asIcon, SharedPtr<Stream> presentation)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'presentation' is omitted and 'asIcon' is set, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the filename for the icon caption.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObjectAsIcon(SharedPtr<Stream> stream, String progId, String iconFile, String iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'iconFile' and 'iconCaption' are omitted, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the predefined icon caption.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObjectAsIcon(String fileName, String progId, bool isLinked, String iconFile, String iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'iconFile' and 'iconCaption' are omitted, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the filename for the icon caption.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObjectAsIcon(String fileName, bool isLinked, String iconFile, String iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'iconFile' and 'iconCaption' are omitted, this overloaded method selects the icon according to the file extension and uses the filename for the icon caption.

Changed XML comments for 'iconCaption' arguments of DocumentBuilder::InsertOleObjectAsIcon() methods:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Inserts an embedded or linked OLE object as icon into the document.
/// Allows to specify icon file and caption. Detects OLE object type using file extension.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="fileName">Full path to the file.</param>
/// <param name="isLinked">
/// If true then linked OLE object is inserted otherwise embedded OLE object is inserted.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconFile">
/// Full path to the ICO file. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use a predefined image.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconCaption">
/// Icon caption. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use the file name.
/// </param>
/// <returns>Shape node containing Ole object and inserted at the current Builder position.</returns>
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObjectAsIcon(String fileName, bool isLinked, String iconFile, String iconCaption)

/// <summary>
/// Inserts an embedded or linked OLE object as icon into the document.
/// Allows to specify icon file and caption. Detects OLE object type using given progID parameter.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="fileName">Full path to the file.</param>
/// <param name="progId">ProgId of OLE object.</param>
/// <param name="isLinked">
/// If true then linked OLE object is inserted otherwise embedded OLE object is inserted.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconFile">
/// Full path to the ICO file. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use a predefined image.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconCaption">
/// Icon caption. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use the file name.
/// </param>
/// <returns>Shape node containing Ole object and inserted at the current Builder position.</returns>
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObjectAsIcon(String fileName, String progId, bool isLinked, String iconFile, String iconCaption)

/// <summary>
/// Inserts an embedded OLE object as icon from a stream into the document.
/// Allows to specify icon file and caption. Detects OLE object type using given progID parameter.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="stream">Stream containing application data.</param>
/// <param name="progId">ProgId of OLE object.</param>
/// <param name="iconFile">
/// Full path to the ICO file. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use a predefined image.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconCaption">
/// Icon caption. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use the a predefined icon caption.
/// </param>
/// <returns>Shape node containing Ole object and inserted at the current Builder position.</returns>
SharedPtr<Shape> InsertOleObjectAsIcon(SharedPtr<Stream> stream, String progId, String iconFile, String iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}

### The behavior of revision tracking feature triggered by Document::StartTrackRevisions was changed

Related issue: WORDSNET-20666

When revisions are tracked using Document::StartTrackRevisions, if a node is moved from one location to another in the same document, move revisions are now generated, including move-from and move-to ranges.

Use Case:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
auto doc = MakeObject<Document>();
auto builder = MakeObject<DocumentBuilder>(doc);
 
// Generate document contents.
builder->Writeln("Paragraph 1");
builder->Writeln("Paragraph 2");
builder->Writeln("Paragraph 3");
builder->Writeln("Paragraph 4");
builder->Writeln("Paragraph 5");
builder->Writeln("Paragraph 6");
 
auto body = doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body();
 
// Returns 7.
std::cout << "Paragraph count: " << body->get_Paragraphs()->get_Count() << '\n';
 
doc->StartTrackRevisions(u"Author", DateTime(2020, 12, 23, 14, 0, 0));
 
auto node = body->get_Paragraphs()->idx_get(3);
auto endNode = body->get_Paragraphs()->idx_get(5)->get_NextSibling();
auto referenceNode = body->get_Paragraphs()->idx_get(0);
 
while (node != endNode)
{
    auto nextNode = node->get_NextSibling();
    body->InsertBefore(node, referenceNode);
    node = nextNode;
}
 
doc->StopTrackRevisions();
 
// Returns 10: there are 3 additional paragraphs in the move-from range.
std::cout << "Paragraph count: " << body->get_Paragraphs()->get_Count() << '\n';
 
doc->Save("out.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}
