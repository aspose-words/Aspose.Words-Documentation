A field that is inserted using [DocumentBuilder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document_builder).[InsertField](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.document_builder#insertfield_fieldtype_bool) returns a [Field](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.fields.field) object. This is a fa—Åade class that provides useful methods to quickly find some properties of a field.

The following code example shows how to find the field code and field result:

Note if you are only looking for the names of merge fields in a document, then you can instead use the built-in [GetFieldNames](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.mail_merging.mail_merge#getfieldnames) method.

The following code example shows how to get names of all merge fields in a document:
