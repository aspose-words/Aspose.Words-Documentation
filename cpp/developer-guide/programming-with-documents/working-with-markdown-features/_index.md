This topic discusses how to implement Markdown features using Aspose.Words. Markdown is a simple way to format plain text that can easily be converted to HTML. Aspose.Words supports the following Markdown features:

- Headings
- Blockquotes
- Horizontal rules
- Bold emphasis
- Italic emphasis

The Markdown feature implementation mostly follows the CommonMark specification in Aspose.Words API and all the features are represented as corresponding styles or direct formatting. Which means that

- Bold and Italic are represented as Font.Bold and Font.Italic. 
- Headings are paragraphs with Heading 1 - Heading 6 styles. 
- Quotes are paragraphs with "Quote" in the style name. 
- HorizontalRule is a paragraph with HorizontalRule shape.

## Markdown Document with Emphases

This section demonstrates you how to produce a markdown document with emphases as given below:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis.
You can write **bold** or *italic* text. 
You can also write ***BoldItalic***text.
{{< /highlight >}}

The following code snippet can be used to produce the above-given markdown document.

## Markdown Document with Headings

This section demonstrates you how to produce a markdown document with headings as given below:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
The following produces headings:
\# Heading1
\## Heading2
\### Heading3
\#### Heading4
\##### Heading5
\###### Heading6
\# **Bold Heading1**
{{< /highlight >}}

The following code snippet can be used to produce the above-given markdown document.

## Markdown Document with Block Quotes

This section demonstrates you how to produce a markdown document with block quotes as given below:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
We support blockquotes in Markdown:
\>*Lorem*
\>*ipsum*
The quotes can be of any level and can be nested:
\>>>Quote level 3
\>>>>Nested quote level 4
\>
\>*Back to first level*
\> ### Headings are allowed inside Quotes
{{< /highlight >}}

The following code snippet can be used to produce the above-given markdown document.

## Markdown Document with Horizontal Rule

This section demonstrates you how to produce a markdown document with Horizontal Rule as given below:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
We support Horizontal rules (Thematic breaks) in Markdown:
\-----
{{< /highlight >}}

The following code snippet can be used to produce the above-given markdown document.

## Specify Markdown Save Options

Aspose.Words API provides [MarkdownSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.saving.markdown_save_options/) class to specify additional options while saving a document into the Markdown format.

The following code example demonstrated how to specify various Markdown save options.

## How to Align Content Inside the Table while Exporting into Markdown

Aspose.Words API provides TableContentAlignment enumeration which defines alignment directions to align contents in tables while exporting into the Markdown document. The following code example demonstrates how to align content inside the table.
