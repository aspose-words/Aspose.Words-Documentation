## Introduction

In Microsoft Word, you can create a form by starting with a template and adding content controls, including check boxes, text boxes, date pickers, and drop-down lists. In Aspose.Words, a Structured Document Tag or content control from any document loaded into Aspose.Words is imported as a StructuredDocumentTag node. Structured document tags (SDT or content control) allow to embed customer-defined semantics as well as its behavior and appearance into a document. StructuredDocumentTag can occur in a document in the following places:

- Block-level - Among paragraphs and tables, as a child of a Body, HeaderFooter, Comment, Footnote or a Shape node.
- Row-level - Among rows in a table, as a child of a Table node.
- Cell-level - Among cells in a table row, as a child of a Row node.
- Inline-level - Among inline content inside, as a child of a Paragraph.
- Nested inside another StructuredDocumentTag.

## How to Use Control Characters

Microsoft Word documents may contain various characters that have a special meaning. Normally they are used for formatting purposes and are not drawn in the normal mode. You can make them visible if you click the Show/Hide Formatting Marks button located on the Standard toolbar. Sometimes you may need to add or remove characters to/from the text. For instance, when obtaining text programmatically from the document, Aspose.Words preserves most of the control characters, so if you need to work with this text you should probably remove or replace the characters.

The ControlChar class is a repository for the constants that represent control characters often encountered in documents. It provides both char and string versions of the same constants. For example, string ControlChar.LineBreak and char ControlChar.LineBreakChar has the same value. The below code example shows how to use control characters.

## How to Set Style to Format Text Typed into the Content Control

If you want to set the style of content control, you can use StructuredDocumentTag.Style or StructuredDocumentTag.StyleName properties.The below code example shows how to set the style of content control. When you type the text into content control in the output document, the typed text will have style "Quote".

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Note that only Linked and Character styles can be applied to content control. An InvalidOperationException ("Cannot apply this style to the SDT") is thrown when a style that exists but is not Linked or Character style is being applied.

{{% /alert %}}

## Working with Repeating Section Content Control

The repeating section content control allows repeating the content contained within it. Using Aspose.Words, the structured document tag nodes of the repeating section and repeating section item types can be created and for this purpose, SdtType enumeration type provides **RepeatingSectionItem** property. The following code example demonstrates how to bind a repeating section content control to a table.
