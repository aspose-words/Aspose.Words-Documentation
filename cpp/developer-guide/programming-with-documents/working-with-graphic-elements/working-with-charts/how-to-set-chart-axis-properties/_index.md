If you want to work with chart axis, scaling, and display units for the value axis, please use [ChartAxis](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.drawing.charts.chart_axis), [AxisDisplayUnit](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.drawing.charts.axis_display_unit), and [AxisScaling](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.drawing.charts.axis_scaling) classes.

The following code example shows how to define X and Y-axis properties:

## How to Set Date-Time Value of Axis

The following code example shows how to set date/time values to axis properties:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-SetDateTimeValuesToAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Format Number Value of Axis

The following code example shows how to change the format of numbers on the value axis:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-SetNumberFormatForAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Set Bounds of Axis

The AxisBound class represents a minimum or maximum bound of axis values. Bound can be specified as a numeric, date-time or a special "auto" value.

The following code example shows how to set the bounds of an axis:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-SetboundsOfAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Set Interval Unit Between Labels

The following code example shows how to set the interval unit between labels on an axis:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-SetIntervalUnitBetweenLabelsOnAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Hide Chart Axis

If you want to show or hide the chart axis, you can simply achieve this by setting the value of the set_Hidden property.

The following code example shows how to hide the Y-axis of the chart:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-HideChartAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Align Chart Label

If you want to set a text alignment for multi-line labels, you can simply achieve this by setting the value of the [TickLabelAlignment](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.drawing.charts/chartaxis/get_ticklabelalignment/) property. The following code example shows how to tick label alignment.
