## **About PCL**

|![todo:image_alt_text](printer-command-language-pcl_1)|<p>PCL - Printer Command Language - is a page description language (PDL) developed by Hewlett-Packard as a printer protocol and has become a de facto industry standard. Originally developed for early inkjet printers in 1984, PCL has been released in varying levels for thermal, matrix printer, and page printers.</p><p>HP introduced PCL 6 around 1995 with the HP LaserJet 4000 series printers. It consists of:</p><p>- PCL 6 Enhanced: An object-oriented PDL optimized for printing from GUI interfaces such as Windows and compressed to optimize throughput. Formerly known as PCL XL.</p><p>- PCL 6 Standard: Equivalent to PCL 5e or PCL 5c, intended to provide backward compatibility.</p><p>- Font synthesis: Provides scalable fonts, font management and storage of forms and fonts.</p>|
