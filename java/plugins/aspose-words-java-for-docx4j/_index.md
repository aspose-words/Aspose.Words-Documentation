## **Introduction**
### **docx4j**
docx4j is an open source (ASLv2) Java library for creating and manipulating Microsoft Open XML Word docx files.
It is similar to Microsoft’s OpenXML SDK, but for Java. docx4j uses JAXB to create the in-memory object representation.
You’ll need to take the time to understand JAXB, and the Open XML file structure.
