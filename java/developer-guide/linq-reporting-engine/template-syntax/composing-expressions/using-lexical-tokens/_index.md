The following table describes lexical tokens that you can use in template expressions and restrictions on these tokens’ usage comparing with C# Language Specification 5.0.

|Token|Restrictions|
| :- | :- |
|**Keyword**|Only the following tokens are reserved as keywords: `true`, `false`, `null`, `new`, and `in`.|
|**Identifier**|- The feature of keyword escaping through the “@” character is not supported.<br>- Unicode character escapes are not permitted in identifiers.|
|**Literal**|- 32-bit Unicode character escapes are not supported.<br>- Unsigned integer and decimal literals are not permitted.|
|**Operator**|See “ REF operators Using Operators.”|

You can use the following identifiers that are not preceded by a member access operator in template expressions:

- The name of a passed data source object
- The name of an iteration variable within its scope (see “ REF seqData Outputting Sequential Data” for more information)
- The name of a common variable after it is declared (see “ REF variables Using Variables” for more information)
- The name of a lambda function parameter within the scope of the lambda function
- A fully or partially qualified name of a type that is known by the engine (see “ REF knownTypes Setting up Known External Types” for more information)
- The name of a member of an object that is determined as follows:
  - Inside a data band body, the object is resolved to the innermost iteration variable.
  - Outside a data band body, the object is resolved to a passed data source.

The feature of the omitting of an object identifier while accessing the object’s members is also known as the contextual object member access. See “ REF contextual Using Contextual Object Member Access” for more information.
