LINQ Reporting Engine enables you to treat `DataTable` objects in template expressions as enumerations of their rows. That is, you can use template expressions evaluated to such objects in `foreach` tags (see "Outputting Sequential Data" for more information).

Also, you can normally apply enumeration extension methods (see "Appendix A. Enumeration Extension Methods" for more information) to `DataTable` objects in template expressions. For example, given that `persons` is a `DataTable` instance, you can count its rows using the following syntax.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
persons.count()
{{< /highlight >}}
