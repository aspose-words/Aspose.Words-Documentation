LINQ Reporting Engine enables you to access `DataTable` objects contained within a particular `DataSet` instance by table names using the “.” operator in template expressions. That is, for example, given that `ds` is a `DataSet` instance that contains a `DataTable` named “Persons”, you can access the
table using the following syntax.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
ds.Persons
{{< /highlight >}}

**Note –** Table names are case-insensitive.
