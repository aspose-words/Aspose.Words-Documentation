## How is the type of an enumeration item implicitly determined by the engine in template expressions?

If you do not specify the type of an enumeration item in a foreach statement or lambda function signature within your template explicitly, the type is implicitly determined by the engine from the type of the enumeration as follows:

1. If the enumeration represents a DataTable instance, then the item represents its row.
1. Otherwise, if the enumeration represents child rows of a DataTable row, then the item represents a child row.
1. Otherwise, if the enumeration implements generic Iterable&lt;T&gt;, then the item type is a type argument corresponding to T. Note, that in some cases it is impossible to extract type arguments at runtime due to the Java [Type Erasure](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html) feature. That is why, the engine is capable to extract the item type only if one of the following conditions is met: 
   1. The enumeration expression represents an invocation of a type member which return type is a parameterized type like Iterable&lt;String&gt;, ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;, and so forth.
   1. The type of the enumeration implements or extends a parameterized type like Iterable&lt;String&gt;, ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;, and so forth.
1. Otherwise, the item type is Object.
