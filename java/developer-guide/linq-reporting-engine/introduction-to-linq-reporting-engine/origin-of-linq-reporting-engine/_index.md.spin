Historically, [Aspose.Words Mail Merge](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/mail-merge-and-reporting/) was the first attempt to bring reporting features to the Aspose.Words component. However, the main purpose of Aspose.Words Mail Merge is mimicking Microsoft Word® Mail Merge. That is why the mail-merge-template syntax is based on Microsoft Word® merge fields. This fact makes it impossible to extend the template syntax keeping it concise, clear, and simple for users.

The concept of LINQ Reporting Engine resolves this issue by using various single-purpose text tags, rather than reusing the same merge fields for various purposes. In general, this approach makes the template syntax much shorter and clearer. Thus, for example, the adding of a new tag type does not pollute the syntax that much. This fact makes the syntax much more extensible and able to satisfy growing customers’ needs.
