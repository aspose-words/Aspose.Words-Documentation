This topic discusses how to programmatically join and append documents using Aspose.Words. Appending documents is a very common task, one which is fully supported. Using Aspose.Words you can easily append one document to another using just a one-line API call. This topic provides details and code examples on how to append documents and how to further control how the documents are joined.
