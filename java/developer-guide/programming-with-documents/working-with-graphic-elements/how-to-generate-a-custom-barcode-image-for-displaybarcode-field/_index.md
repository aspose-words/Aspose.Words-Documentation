Aspose.Words has an interface for generating custom barcodes which makes it very easy to use [Aspose.Words](http://www.aspose.com/products/words/java) and [Aspose.BarCode](http://www.aspose.com/java/barcode-component.aspx) together to render barcode images in output documents. For example, you can load a DOC, OOXML or RTF document containing DISPLAYBARCODE Field into Aspose.Words, provide your implementation of custom barcode generator and save to fixed page formats such as PDF, XPS etc. A typical DISPLAYBARCODE field has the following syntax:

{ DISPLAYBARCODE "SomeData" QR \h 720 }
