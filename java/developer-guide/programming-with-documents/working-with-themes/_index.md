## How to Manipulate Theme Properties

We have added basic API in Aspose.Words to access document theme properties. For now, this API includes the following public objects:

- Theme
- ThemeFonts
- ThemeColors

Here is how you can get theme properties:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "827e71ccc0b8516a3cfe247b86ce6d4e" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-words-examples-programming_documents-Theme-GetThemeProperties-1.java" >}}

And here is how you can set theme properties:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "827e71ccc0b8516a3cfe247b86ce6d4e" "Examples-src-main-java-com-aspose-words-examples-programming_documents-Theme-SetThemeProperties-1.java" >}}
