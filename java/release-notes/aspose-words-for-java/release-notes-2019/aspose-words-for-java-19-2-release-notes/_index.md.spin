## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 19.2. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Adjusted Warnings for Image Processing Issues When Saving to PDF

WORDSNET-17338 has now been resolved.

Previously there was one generic warning with text "Unsupported image format.". Now there is a specific warning for OutOfMemoryException with the text "Not enough memory to load the image." and a generic warning with the text "Image cannot be processed. Possibly unsupported image format.".

### Changes in Font Substitution Process and Public API

WORDSNET-14532 has now been resolved:

### Font fetching and substitution mechanism has been changed

Previously font fetching process was:

1. Exact font name match
1. Embedded font data from the document
1. Font Substitutes specified for the font name
1. AltName from FontInfo (if any) and the substitutes for AltName
1. Font substitution if FontInfo is present and EnableFontSubstitution is set.
1. DefaultFontName and the substitutes for DefaultFontName
1. Any font from available font sources
1. “Fanwood” font embedded into assembly.

Now font fetching process is:

1. Exact font name match
1. Embedded font data from the document
1. AltName from FontInfo (if any)
1. Font Substitution rules
   1. fontconfigsubstitution
   1. Table substitution for the font name and alt name
   1. Font info substitution
   1. Default font substitution
1. Any font from available font sources
1. “Fanwood” font embedded into assembly.

Here are some details about the particular changes:

- Font Substitutes mechanism is replaced with table font substitution rule. Previously Font Substitutes mechanism was not a part of font substitution process. Fonts selected via Font Substitutes was considered properly resolved. Now table substitution rule is a regular part of font substitution process. This implies that table substitution rule is not used now in several cases where Font Substitutes previously was used. In particular table substitution is not used now when performing font fallback and checking default font substitution rule. Customers could setup suitable fallback table viaFontSettings.FallbackSettings.
- To better fit MS Word behavior, several well-known font aliases used unconditionally by MS Word are removed from default Windows font substitution table. Now Aspose.Words checks them before performing font substitution.
- Added new feature to use thefontconfigutility to get the substitution fonts. fontconfig is designed to provide system-wide font configuration, customization and application access on Linux (and other Unix-like) systems.
- Font substitution warnings messages are changed. Now they are in format "Font '<OriginalFont>' has not been found. Using '<SubstitutionFont>' font instead. Reason: <Reason>." with reasons:
  - "alternative name from the document" for substitution by FontInfo.AltName
  - "fontconfigsubstitution" for substitution by font config rule
  - "table substitution" for substitution by table rule
  - "font info substitution" for substitution by font info rule
  - "default font substitution" for substitution by default font rule
  - "first available font" for substitution with first available font


### Added new public API for font substitution settings. Previous API methods/properties related to font substitution marked as obsolete.

### Supported Inlining of Syntax Error Messages into Templates Instead of Exception Throwing for LINQ Reporting Engine

**Issues:** WORDSNET-16111, WORDSNET-15203, WORDSNET-13756

The "Inlining Syntax Error Messages into Templates" section of the engine's documentation was added to describe the change.


### Removed Deprecated Public Property TxtSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFooters

**Issue**: WORDSNET-17560

Removed deprecated public property TxtSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFooters:



{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Specifies whether to output headers and footers when exporting in plain text format.

// Default value is <b>true</b>.
public bool ExportHeadersFooters
{{< /highlight >}}



Please use *TxtSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFootersMode* property instead.
