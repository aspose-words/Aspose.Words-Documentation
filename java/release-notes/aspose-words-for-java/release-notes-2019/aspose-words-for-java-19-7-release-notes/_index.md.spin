## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 19.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.


### Added property Revision.Group

Related issue: WORDSNET-18418

Added the following new property to the Revision class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets the revision group. Returns null if the revision does not belong to any group.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Revision has no group if revision type is RevisionType.StyleDefinitionChange or
/// if the revision is not longer exist in document context (accepted/rejected).
/// </remarks>
public RevisionGroup Group
{{< /highlight >}}

**Use Case:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(@"source.docx");
foreach (Revision revision in doc.Revisions)
{
    string groupText = revision.Group != null
        ? "Revision group text: " + revision.Group.Text
        : "Revision has no group";
    Console.WriteLine("Type: " + revision.RevisionType);
    Console.WriteLine("Author: " + revision.Author);
    Console.WriteLine("Date: " + revision.DateTime);
    Console.WriteLine("Revision text: " + revision.ParentNode.ToString(SaveFormat.Text));
    Console.WriteLine(groupText);
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Implemented basic reader and writer for Markdown features

Related issue: WORDSNET-18338.

For a moment the following Markdown features are supported:

- Headings
- Block quotes
- Horizontal rules
- Bold emphasis
- Italic emphasis

The new public enumerations were added:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
LoadFormat.Markdown
SaveFormat.Markdown
FileFormat.Markdown
{{< /highlight >}}

The new TxtSaveOptionsBase class was added:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// The base class for specifying additional options when saving a document into a text based formats.
/// </summary>
public abstract class TxtSaveOptionsBase : SaveOptions
{{< /highlight >}}

Some of the members were moved from the TxtSaveOptions class into TxtSaveOptionsBase class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the encoding to use when exporting in text formats. 
/// Default value is <ms><b>Encoding.UTF8</b></ms><java>'UTF-8' Charset</java>.
/// </summary>
public Encoding Encoding
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the string to use as a paragraph break when exporting in text formats.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>The default value is <see cref="ControlChar.CrLf"/>.</p>
/// </remarks>
public string ParagraphBreak
/// <summary>
/// Specifies whether the program should attempt to preserve layout of tables when saving in the plain text format.
/// The default value is <b>false</b>.
/// </summary>
public bool PreserveTableLayout
/// <summary>
/// <para>Allows to specify whether the page breaks should be preserved during export.</para>
/// <para>The default value is <b>false</b>.</para>
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The property affects only page breaks that are inserted explicitly into a document. 
/// It is not related to page breaks that MS Word automatically inserts at the end of each page.
/// </remarks>
public bool ForcePageBreaks
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the way headers and footers are exported to the text formats.
/// Default value is <see cref="TxtExportHeadersFootersMode.PrimaryOnly"/>.
/// </summary>
public TxtExportHeadersFootersMode ExportHeadersFootersMode
{{< /highlight >}}

Our implementation is mostly follows the CommonMark specification.
In AW model Markdown features are represented as corresponding styles or direct formatting.
So, bold and italic are represented as Font.Bold and Font.Italic.
Headings are paragraphs with Heading 1 - Heading 6 styles.
Quotes are paragraphs with "Quote" in style name.
HorizontalRule is a paragraph with HorizontalRule shape.

**Use Case 1. Explains how to produce the following Markdown document with emphases:**

{{< highlight html >}}
Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis.
You can write **bold** or *italic* text. 
You can also write ***BoldItalic***text.
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(new Document());
builder.Writeln("Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis.");
builder.Write("You can write ");
builder.Font.Bold = true;
builder.Write("bold");
builder.Font.Bold = false;
builder.Write(" or ");
builder.Font.Italic = true;
builder.Write("italic");
builder.Font.Italic = false;
builder.Writeln(" text. ");
builder.Write("You can also write ");
builder.Font.Bold = true;
builder.Font.Italic = true;
builder.Write("BoldItalic");
builder.Font.Bold = false;
builder.Font.Italic = false;
builder.Write("text.");
builder.Document.Save("EmphasesExample.md");
{{< /highlight >}}

**Use Case 2. Explains how to produce the following Markdown document with Headings:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
The following produces headings:
\# Heading1
\## Heading2
\### Heading3
\#### Heading4
\##### Heading5
\###### Heading6
\# **Bold Heading1**
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// By default Heading styles in Word may have bold and italic formatting.

// If we do not want text to be emphasized, set these properties explicitly to false.
builder.Font.Bold = false;
builder.Font.Italic = false;
builder.Writeln("The following produces headings:");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Heading 1"];
builder.Writeln("Heading1");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Heading 2"];
builder.Writeln("Heading2");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Heading 3"];
builder.Writeln("Heading3");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Heading 4"];
builder.Writeln("Heading4");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Heading 5"];
builder.Writeln("Heading5");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Heading 6"];
builder.Writeln("Heading6");

// Note, emphases are also allowed inside Headings:
builder.Font.Bold = true;
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Heading 1"];
builder.Writeln("Bold Heading1");
doc.Save("HeadingsExample.md");
{{< /highlight >}}

**Use Case 3. Explains how to produce the following Markdown document with block quotes:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
We support blockquotes in Markdown:
\>*Lorem*
\>*ipsum*
The quotes can be of any level and can be nested:
\>>>Quote level 3
\>>>>Nested quote level 4
\>
\>*Back to first level*
\> ### Headings are allowed inside Quotes
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.Writeln("We support blockquotes in Markdown:");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Quote"];
builder.Writeln("Lorem");
builder.Writeln("ipsum");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Normal"];
builder.Writeln("The quotes can be of any level and can be nested:");
Style quoteLevel3 = doc.Styles.Add(StyleType.Paragraph, "Quote2");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = quoteLevel3;
builder.Writeln("Quote level 3");
Style quoteLevel4 = doc.Styles.Add(StyleType.Paragraph, "Quote3");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = quoteLevel4;
builder.Writeln("Nested quote level 4");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Quote"];
builder.Writeln();
builder.Writeln("Back to first level");
Style quoteLevel1WithHeading = doc.Styles.Add(StyleType.Paragraph, "Quote Heading 3");
builder.ParagraphFormat.Style = quoteLevel1WithHeading;
builder.Write("Headings are allowed inside Quotes");
doc.Save("QuotesExample.md");
{{< /highlight >}}



**Use Case 4. Explains how to produce the following Markdown document with Horizontal Rule:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
We support Horizontal rules (Thematic breaks) in Markdown:
\-----
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(new Document());
builder.Writeln("We support Horizontal rules (Thematic breaks) in Markdown:");
builder.InsertHorizontalRule();
builder.Document.Save("HorizontalRuleExample.md");
{{< /highlight >}}



**Use Case 5. Explains how to read Markdown document.**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// This is Markdown document that was produced in example of UC3.
Document doc = new Document("QuotesExample.md");

// Let's remove Heading formatting from a Quote in the very last paragraph.
Paragraph paragraph = doc.FirstSection.Body.LastParagraph;
paragraph.ParagraphFormat.Style = doc.Styles["Quote"];
doc.Save("QuotesModifiedExample.md");
{{< /highlight >}}


### Implemented feature to detect SmartArt shape

Related issue: WORDSNET-18745.

Added the following new property to a Shape class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns true if this Shape has a SmartArt object.
/// </summary>
public bool HasSmartArt
{{< /highlight >}}

**Use Case: Count a number of shapes with SmartArt in a document.**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(@"input.docx");
int count = 0;
foreach (Shape shape in doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true))
{
    if (shape.HasSmartArt)
        count++;
}
Console.WriteLine("The document has {0} shapes with SmartArt.", count);
{{< /highlight >}}


### Supported dynamic list numbering restart for LINQ Reporting Engine

Issue: WORDSNET-17234

The "[Restarting List Numbering Dynamically](/words/java/restarting-list-numbering-dynamically/)" section of the engine's documentation was added to describe the change.


### WORDSNET-11297 - Implemented public API for dealing with linked textboxes

New public properties and methods were added into the TextBox class.

A public property for getting parent shape from text box was added to allow customer to find linked Shape from linked TextBox.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Determines whether this TextBox can be linked to the target Textbox.
/// </summary>
public bool IsValidLinkTarget(TextBox target)
{
}
/// <summary>
/// Returns or sets a TextBox that represents the next TextBox in a sequence of shapes.
/// </summary>
public TextBox Next
{
  get; set;
}
/// <summary>
/// Returns a TextBox that represents the previous TextBox in a sequence of shapes.
/// </summary>
public TextBox Previous
{
  get;
}
/// <summary>
/// Breaks the forward link for the specified TextBox, if such a link exists.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// BreakForwardLink() doesn't break all other links in the current sequence of shapes.
/// For example: 1-2-3-4 sequence and BreakForwardLink at the 2-nd textbox will create
/// two sequences 1-2, 3-4.
/// </remarks>
public void BreakForwardLink()
{
}
/// <summary>
/// Gets a parent shape for the TextBox.
/// </summary>
public Shape Parent
{
    get { return mParent; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

**Use Case to create a link from shape1.TextBox to shape2.TextBox:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
TextBox textBox1 = shape1.TextBox;
TextBox textBox2 = shape2.TextBox;
if (textBox1.IsValidLinkTarget(textBox2))
  textBox1.Next = textBox2;
{{< /highlight >}}

**Use Case to check if shape.TextBox is a Head, a Tail or a Middle of the sequence:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
TextBox textBox = shape.TextBox;
if ((textBox.Next != null) && (textBox.Previous == null))
{
  //The head of the sequence.
}
if ((textBox.Next != null) && (textBox.Previous != null))
{
  //The Middle of the sequence.
}
if ((textBox.Next == null) && (textBox.Previous != null))
{
  //The Tail of the sequence.
}
{{< /highlight >}}

**Use Case to break a link for a shape.TextBox:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
TextBox textBox = shape.TextBox;

// Break a forward link
textBox.BreakForwardLink();

// Break a forward link by setting a null
textBox.Next = null;

// Break a link, which leads to this textbox
if (textBox.Previous != null)
  textBox.Previous.BreakForwardLink();
{{< /highlight >}}
