## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 17.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added an Interface to Flexibly Format Field Result

WORDSNET-14944 has been resolved.

We have added an interface allowing to implement a custom formatting of field's result. The original request was about adding a feature to remove spaces between sign and digits during mail merge. However, we decided to implement a more generic and flexible solution because our API is already overwhelmed with different specific properties.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
Document document = builder.getDocument();
Field field = builder.insertField("=-1234567.89 \\# \"### ### ###.000\"", null);
document.getFieldOptions().setResultFormatter(new FieldResultFormatter("[%0$s]", null));
field.update();
document.save("FormatFieldResult_out.docx");
/////implementation of IFieldResultFormatter////////
public class FieldResultFormatter implements IFieldResultFormatter {
	private final String mNumberFormat;
	private final String mDateFormat;
	private final ArrayList mNumberFormatInvocations = new ArrayList();
	private final ArrayList mDateFormatInvocations = new ArrayList();
	public FieldResultFormatter(String numberFormat, String dateFormat) {
		mNumberFormat = numberFormat;
		mDateFormat = dateFormat;
	}
	public FieldResultFormatter() {
		mNumberFormat = null;
		mDateFormat = null;
	}
	public String format(String arg0, int arg1) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return null;
	}
	public String format(double arg0, int arg1) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return null;
	}
	public String formatNumeric(double value, String format) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		mNumberFormatInvocations.add(new Object[] { value, format });
		return (mNumberFormat.isEmpty() || mNumberFormat == null) ? null
				: String.format(mNumberFormat, value);
	}
	public String formatDateTime(Date value, String format, int calendarType) {
		mDateFormatInvocations
				.add(new Object[] { value, format, calendarType });
		return (mDateFormat.isEmpty() || mDateFormat == null) ? null : String
				.format(mDateFormat, value);
	}
}

### Added Feature to Set Horizontal and Vertical Resolution of Output Image

Previously it was one property Resolution that set both vertical and horizontal resolution to the same values.
Now new public properties HorizontalResolution and VerticalResolution are added into the ImageSaveOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the horizontal resolution for the generated images, in dots per inch.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>This property has effect only when saving to raster image formats.</para>
/// <p>The default value is 96.</p>
/// </remarks>
public float HorizontalResolution {get;set;}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the vertical resolution for the generated images, in dots per inch.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>This property has effect only when saving to raster image formats.</para>
/// <p>The default value is 96.</p>
/// </remarks>
public float VerticalResolution {get;set;}
{{< /highlight >}}

Please note, that Resolution property became write-only:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Sets both horizontal and vertical resolution for the generated images, in dots per inch.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>This property has effect only when saving to raster image formats.</para>
/// </remarks>
public float Resolution {set;}
{{< /highlight >}}
