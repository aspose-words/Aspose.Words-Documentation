## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 17.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.


### Added Public Method CustomXmlPartCollection.add(string id, string xml)

A public method is added into the CustomXmlPartCollection class to help in creation of a custom XML part by specifying its XML:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Creates a new XML part with the specified XML and adds it to the collection.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="id">Identifier of a new custom XML part.</param>
/// <param name="xml">XML data of the part.</param>
/// <returns>Created custom XML part.</returns>
public CustomXmlPart add(string id, string xml)
{{< /highlight >}}

Value of the 'xml' parameter is encoded as UTF8 and is stored in creating XML part.

#### UC for creating a custom XML part by specifying its XML

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
CustomXmlPart xmlPart = doc.getCustomXmlParts().add(UUID.fromString("B").toString(), "<root><text>Hello, World!</text></root>");
StructuredDocumentTag sdt = new StructuredDocumentTag(doc, SdtType.PLAIN_TEXT, MarkupLevel.BLOCK);
sdt.getXmlMapping().setMapping(xmlPart, "/root[1]/text[1]", "");
doc.getFirstSection().getBody().appendChild(sdt);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Implemented API to Bind StructuredDocumentTag to Node of Custom XML Part

WORDSNET-4738 has been resolved. The following public property is added into the StructuredDocumentTag class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets an object that represents the mapping of this structured document tag to XML data
/// in a custom XML part of the current document.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// You can use the <see cref="Markup.XmlMapping.SetMapping"/> method of this object to map
/// a structured document tag to XML data.
/// </remarks>
public XmlMapping getXmlMapping()
{{< /highlight >}}

Public methods of the XmlMapping class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the information that is used to establish a mapping between the parent
/// structured document tag and an XML element stored within a custom XML data part in the document.
/// </summary>
public class XmlMapping
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Sets a mapping between the parent structured document tag and an XML node of a custom XML data part.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="customXmlPart">A custom XML data part to map to.</param>
    /// <param name="xPath">An XPath expression to find the XML node.</param>
    /// <param name="prefixMapping">XML namespace prefix mappings to evaluate the XPath.</param>
    /// <returns>A flag indicating whether the parent structured document tag is successfully mapped to
    /// the XML node.</returns>
    public boolean setMapping(CustomXmlPart customXmlPart, string xPath, string prefixMapping);
    /// <summary>
    /// Deletes mapping of the parent structured document to XML data.
    /// </summary>
    public void delete();
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the custom XML data part to which the parent structured document tag is mapped.
    /// </summary>
    public CustomXmlPart getCustomXmlPart()
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the XPath expression, which is evaluated to find the custom XML node
    /// that is mapped to the parent structured document tag.
    /// </summary>
    public string getXPath()
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns XML namespace prefix mappings to evaluate the <see cref="XPath"/>.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Specifies the set of prefix mappings, which shall be used to interpret the XPath expression
    /// when the XPath expression is evaluated against the custom XML data parts in the document.
    /// </remarks>
    public string getPrefixMappings()
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns <b>true</b> if the parent structured document tag is successfully mapped to XML data.
    /// </summary>
    public boolean isMapped()
}
{{< /highlight >}}

#### UC for creation of an XML part and binding a content control to it

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
CustomXmlPart xmlPart = doc.getCustomXmlParts().add(UUID.fromString("B").toString(), "<root><text>Hello, World!</text></root>");
StructuredDocumentTag sdt = new StructuredDocumentTag(doc, SdtType.PLAIN_TEXT, MarkupLevel.BLOCK);
doc.getFirstSection().getBody().appendChild(sdt);
sdt.getXmlMapping().setMapping(xmlPart, "/root[1]/text[1]", "");
doc.save(fileName);
{{< /highlight >}}

### CellFormat.setPaddings Method was Introduced.

WORDSNET-15014 (Enhancement) has been resolved. We have added a simple method allowing to set all cell paddings in one line of code.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Sets the amount of space (in points) to add to the left/top/right/bottom of the contents of cell.
/// </summary>
public void setPaddings(double leftPadding, double topPadding, double rightPadding, double bottomPadding)
{{< /highlight >}}

You can use this method instead of using four properties:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Set all cell paddings.
builder.getCellFormat().setPaddings(30, 40, 50, 60);
{{< /highlight >}}
