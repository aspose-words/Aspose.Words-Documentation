## Major Features

There are 106 improvements and fixes in this regular monthly release. The most notable are:

- LINQ Reporting Engine supports dynamic shape background coloring.
- Improved optional hyphen handling and fixed related infinite loop issue.
- Improved floating table re-breaking in specific scenarios where content of a table used to be lost outside of a page.
- Improved table grid computation when cells contain tab characters.
- Further improved character spacing control handling.
- PCL documents rendering improved. UCS-2 symbol sets can now be mapped to the printer built-in fonts – it allows to print non-ascii symbols with built-in fonts if supported by printer.
- A ‘cosmetic’ pen (i.e. pen with fixed 1-pixel width) rendering improved in metafile output documents.
- Font metrics calculation affecting the vertical positioning of text for GDI+ output rendering improved.
- Added fallback for strokes with unsupported binary raster operations in metafile rendering.
- Gamma-correction flag is now taken into account while rendering metafiles brushes.
- Metafile warnings improved:
  Added warnings for unsupported binary raster operations.
  Removed warnings about unsupported metafile records which do not affect the output.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes


This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 17.11. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Supported Dynamic Shape Fill Color Setting for LINQ Reporting Engine

The "Setting Text Background Color Dynamically" section of the engine's documentation was renamed to "[Setting Background Color Dynamically](/words/java/setting-background-color-dynamically/)" and updated to describe the change.

### Added Word2016 Constant into MsWordVersion Enumeration Type

Related issue WORDSNET-14771.

The following constant is added into the MsWordVersion enumeration type.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Optimize Aspose.Words behavior to match MS Word 2016 version.
/// </summary>
WORD_2016
{{< /highlight >}}

It can be passed into the CompatibilityOptions.OptimizeFor method to optimize the document contents as well as Aspose.Words behavior to match MS Word 2016 version.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
doc.getCompatibilityOptions().optimizeFor(MsWordVersion.WORD_2016);
{{< /highlight >}}

### To Set File Name and Extension when Inserting Ole Object using MemoryStream

Related Issue: WORDSNET-15616

The public property OlePackage was added to the OleFormat class to provide ability to set file name, extension and display name for OLE Package.
The OlePackage class has 2 public properties:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class OlePackage
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets OLE Package file name.
    /// </summary>
    java.lang.String	getFileName()	
    void	setFileName(java.lang.String value)
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets OLE Package display name.
    /// </summary>
    java.lang.String	getDisplayName()	
    void	setDisplayName(java.lang.String value)
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The example:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
//use case
Document document = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(document);
InputStream stream = null;
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("aaa.zip");
stream = fis;
Shape shape = builder.insertOleObject(stream, "Package", true, null);
OlePackage olePackage = shape.getOleFormat().getOlePackage();
olePackage.setFileName("aaa.zip");
olePackage.setDisplayName("aaa.zip");
document.save("output.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Changed Behavior of Range.Replace Methods

Related issue WORDSNET-15624

Behaviour of the following methods of the Range class is changed.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public int Replace(string pattern, string replacement, FindReplaceOptions options);
public int Replace(Regex pattern, string replacement, FindReplaceOptions options)
{{< /highlight >}}

Now headers/footers of a section are processed in this order:

- If Section.PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter is ‘True’:
  - First header
  - First footer
  - Even header
  - Even footer
  - Primary header
  - Primary footer
- If Section.PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter is ‘False’:
  - Primary header
  - Primary footer
  - Even header
  - Even footer

### Remove Obsolete Methods in DigitalSignatureUtil

Related issue: WORDSNET-15712

Removed obsolete public methods from DigitalSignatureUtil class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public static void Sign(string srcFileName, string dstFileName, System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 certificate, string comments, DateTime signTime);
public static void Sign(string srcFileName, string dstFileName, CertificateHolder certHolder, string comments,DateTime signTime);
public static void Sign(string srcFileName, string dstFileName, CertificateHolder certHolder, string comments, DateTime signTime, string srcPassword);
public static void Sign(Stream srcStream, Stream dstStream, System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2 certificate, string comments, DateTime signTime);
public static void Sign(Stream srcStream, Stream dstStream, CertificateHolder certHolder, string comments, DateTime signTime);
public static void Sign(Stream srcStream, Stream dstStream, CertificateHolder certHolder, string comments, DateTime signTime, string srcPassword);
{{< /highlight >}}

Instead, the methods with SignOptions class should be used. See following headings:

- [Implemented Signing Signature Line in Word Documents](/words/java/aspose-words-for-java-17-8-release-notes/) (17.8 release notes)
- [Provided API Similar to SignatureSet.AddSignatureLine Method in MS Office](/words/java/aspose-words-for-java-17-10-release-notes/) (17.10 release notes)

### Metafile Warnings Improved

Related issue: WORDSNET-15969

- Added warnings for unsupported binary raster operations. Also added fallback to bitmap rendering in this case on .NET platform.
- Removed warnings about unsupported metafile records which do not affect the output.
- Changed type of warnings about unsupported metafile records from DataLoss/UnexpectedContent to more appropriate MinorFormattingLoss.

### Get Position of Floating Table in Public API

Related issue: WORDSNET-15981 

Added new public property for floating tables in Table class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets the base object from which the horizontal positioning in the <see cref="AbsoluteHorizontalDistance"/>
/// and/or <see cref="RelativeHorizontalAlignment"/> attribute should be calculated.
/// Default value is <see cref="RelativeHorizontalPosition.Column"/>.
/// </summary>
public int getHorizontalAnchor()
/// <summary>
/// Gets the base object from which the vertical positioning in the <see cref="AbsoluteVerticalDistance"/>
/// attribute should be calculated.
/// Default value is <see cref="RelativeVerticalPosition.Margin"/>.
/// </summary>
public int getVerticalAnchor()
/// <summary>
/// Gets table absolute horizontal position relative to the horizontal anchor
/// specified by the <see cref="HorizontalAnchor"/>, in points.
/// Default value is 0.
/// </summary>
public double getAbsoluteHorizontalDistance()
/// <summary>
/// Gets table absolute vertical position relative to the vertical anchor
/// specified by the <see cref="VerticalAnchor"/>, in points.
/// Default value is 0.
/// </summary>
public double getAbsoluteVerticalDistance()
/// <summary>
/// Gets whether a floating table shall allow other floating tables in the document
/// to overlap its extents when displayed.
/// Default value is <c>true</c>.
/// </summary>
public boolean AllowOverlap
{{< /highlight >}}

**UC:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("document.xml");
for (Table table: (Iterable<Table>) doc.getFirstSection().getBody().getTables())
{
    // If table is floating type then print its positioning properties.
    if (table.getTextWrapping() == TextWrapping.AROUND)
    {
    	System.out.println(table.getHorizontalAnchor());
    	System.out.println(table.getVerticalAnchor());
    	System.out.println(table.getAbsoluteHorizontalDistance());
    	System.out.println(table.getAbsoluteVerticalDistance());
    	System.out.println(table.getAllowOverlap());
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added the FieldIf.EvaluateCondition() Method

Related issue: WORDSNET-15903

Customer wanted to evaluate IF condition after mail merge and was requesting some API for it. Since the ComparisonOperator, LeftExpression and RightExpression properties of FieldIf did not fulfill customer requirements, we have introduced the FieldIf.EvaluateCondition() method that immediately returns the result of expression's evaluation.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Evaluates the condition.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>
/// A <see cref="FieldIfComparisonResult"/> value that represents the result of the condition evaluation.
/// </returns>
public int evaluateCondition()
{{< /highlight >}}

FieldIfComparisonResult enumeration:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies result of the IF field condition evaluation.
/// </summary>
public enum FieldIfComparisonResult
{
    /// <summary>
    /// There is an error in condition.
    /// </summary>
    ERROR,
    /// <summary>
    /// The condition is <c>true</c>.
    /// </summary>
    TRUE,
    /// <summary>
    /// The condition is <c>false</c>.
    /// </summary>
    FALSE
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Usage:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
FieldIf field = (FieldIf)builder.insertField("IF 1 = 1", null);
int actualResult = field.evaluateCondition();
switch (actualResult) {
    case 0:
        System.out.println("ERROR");
        break;
    case 1:
        System.out.println("TRUE");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("FALSE");
        break;
}
{{< /highlight >}}
