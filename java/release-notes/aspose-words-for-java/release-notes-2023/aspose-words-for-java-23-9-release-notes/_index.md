/// Charts</a> documentation article.
/// </summary>
public class ChartAxisTitle
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the text of the axis title.
    /// If <c>null</c> or empty value is specified, auto generated title will be shown.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>Use <see cref="Show"/> option if you need to show the title.</remarks>
    public string Text { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Determines whether other chart elements shall be allowed to overlap the title.
    /// The default value is <c>false</c>.
    /// </summary>
    public bool Overlay { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Determines whether the title shall be shown for the axis.
    /// The default value is <c>false</c>.
    /// </summary>
    public bool Show { get; set; }
}

public class ChartAxis
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to the axis title properties.
    /// </summary>
    public ChartAxisTitle Title { get; }
}

### Changed MetafileRenderingOptions properties related to metafile size on page emulation

**ScaleWmfFontsToMetafileSize** property is replaced with **EmulateRenderingToSizeOnPage** and added **EmulateRenderingToSizeOnPageResolution**.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value determining whether metafile rendering emulates the display of the metafile according to the size on page
/// or the display of the metafile in its default size.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>When metafiles are displayed in MS Word, some graphics may be scaled according to the actual metafile size in pixels.
/// I.e. even zooming may affect the metafile display.</para>
///
/// <p>When this value is set to <c>true</c>, Aspose.Words emulates rendering according to the metafile size on page.
/// The size in pixels is calculated from the metafile size on the page and the specified <see cref="EmulateRenderingToSizeOnPageResolution"/>.</p>
///
/// <p>When this value is set to <c>false</c>, Aspose.Words emulates metafile rendering to its default size in pixels.</p>
///
/// <p>This option is used only when metafile is rendered as vector graphics.</p>
///
/// <p>The default value is <c>true</c>.</p>
/// </remarks>
public bool EmulateRenderingToSizeOnPage { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the resolution in pixels per inch for the emulation of metafile rendering to the size on page.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>This option is used only when <see cref="EmulateRenderingToSizeOnPage"/> is set to <c>true</c>.</p>
///
/// <p>The default value is 96. This is a default display resolution. I.e. metafile rendering will emulate the display of
/// the metafile in MS Word with a 100% zoom factor.</p>
/// </remarks>
public int EmulateRenderingToSizeOnPageResolution { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

### Removed obsolete property ChildNodes from CompositeNode class

Related issue: WORDSNET-25439

The obsolete public property **ChildNodes** is removed from **Aspose.Words.CompositeNode** class.
Note, the removed ChildNodes is equivalent to calling GetChildNodes(NodeType, bool) with arguments (NodeType.Any and false)
Please check the following example:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Node[] children = source.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Any, false).ToArray();
