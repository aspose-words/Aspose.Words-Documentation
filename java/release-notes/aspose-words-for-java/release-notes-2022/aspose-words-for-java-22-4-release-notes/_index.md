## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added saving to PDFA-4

Related issue: WORDSNET-23475

PDF/A-4 (ISO-19005-4:2020) is the latest version of PDF/A format. In PDF/A-4 conformance levels has been revised. 
Unlike previous versions PDF/A-4 do not provide A, B and U conformance levels. The regular PDF/A-4 conformance is equivalent to the level U conformance of previous versions (i.e. document visual preservation and text Unicode representation). 
Level A conformance (logical structure requirements) is removed as there is PDF/UA format related to this purpose.

New values added to PdfCompliance enum:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public enum PdfCompliance
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The output file will comply with the PDF/A-4 (ISO 19005-4:2020) standard.
    /// PDF/A-4 has the objective of preserving document static visual appearance over time, independent of the tools
    /// and systems used for creating, storing or rendering the files. Additionally any text contained in the document
    /// can be reliably extracted as a series of Unicode codepoints.
    /// </summary>
    PdfA4
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Following options are prohibited when saving to PDF/A-4:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class PdfSaveOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies whether to preserve Microsoft Word form fields as form fields in PDF or convert them to text.
    /// Default is <c>false</c>.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para>Editable forms are prohibited by PDF/A compliance. <c>false</c> value will be used automatically
    /// when saving to PDF/A.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    public bool PreserveFormFields;
  
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the details for encrypting the output PDF document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para>Encryption is prohibited by PDF/A compliance. This option will be ignored when saving to PDF/A.</para>
    public PdfEncryptionDetails EncryptionDetails;
  
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies the font embedding mode.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para>PDF/A and PDF/UA compliance requires all fonts to be embedded.
    /// <see cref="PdfFontEmbeddingMode.EmbedAll"/> value will be used automatically when saving to
    /// PDF/A and PDF/UA.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    public PdfFontEmbeddingMode FontEmbeddingMode;
  
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a value determining whether or not to substitute TrueType fonts Arial, Times New Roman,
    /// Courier New and Symbol with core PDF Type 1 fonts.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para>PDF/A and PDF/UA compliance requires all fonts to be embedded. <c>false</c> value will be used
    /// automatically when saving to PDF/A and PDF/UA.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    public bool UseCoreFonts;
  
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a value determining the way <see cref="Document.CustomDocumentProperties"/> are exported to PDF file.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para><see cref="PdfCustomPropertiesExport.Metadata"/> value is not supported when saving to PDF/A.
    /// <see cref="PdfCustomPropertiesExport.Standard"/> will be used instead for PDF/A-1 and PDF/A-2 and
    /// <see cref="PdfCustomPropertiesExport.None"/> for PDF/A-4.</para>
    ...
    /// </remarks>
    public PdfCustomPropertiesExport CustomPropertiesExport;
  
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies how the color space will be selected for the images in PDF document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para><see cref="PdfImageColorSpaceExportMode.SimpleCmyk"/> value is not supported when saving to PDF/A.
    /// <see cref="PdfImageColorSpaceExportMode.Auto"/> value will be used instead.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    public PdfImageColorSpaceExportMode ImageColorSpaceExportMode;
  
    /// <summary>
    /// A flag indicating whether image interpolation shall be performed by a conforming reader.
    /// When <c>false</c> is specified, the flag is not written to the output document and
    /// the default behaviour of reader is used instead.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para>Interpolation flag is prohibited by PDF/A compliance. <c>false</c> value will be used automatically
    /// when saving to PDF/A.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    public bool InterpolateImages;
}

### Implemented an ability to set Chart.SourceFullName property

Related issue: WORDSNET-23522.

Implemented an ability to specify the name of an xls/xlsx file the DrawingML chart is linked to:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets the path and name of an xls/xlsx file this chart is linked to.
/// </summary>
public string SourceFullName { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(fileName);
Shape shape = (Shape)doc.GetChild(NodeType.Shape, 0, true);
shape.Chart.SourceFullName = @"C:\Documents\ChartData.xlsx";
doc.Save(fileName);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Implemented a new mode of import HTML block-level elements

Related issue: WORDSNET-16334

New HTML loading option was added to HtmlLoadOptions class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class HtmlLoadOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a value that specifies how properties of block-level elements are imported.
    /// Default value is <see cref="BlockImportMode.Merge"/>.
    /// </summary>
    public BlockImportMode BlockImportMode { get; set; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

New BlockImportMode enum specifies how properties of block-level elements are imported:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how properties of block-level elements are imported from HTML-based documents.
/// </summary>
public enum BlockImportMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Properties of parent blocks are merged and stored on child elements (i.e. paragraphs or tables).
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// Properties of parent blocks are merged as follows: margins are added together; borders of higher-level blocks
    /// are discarded and only the most inner-level borders are preserved. As a result, when this mode is specified,
    /// some formatting of blocks from the original document will be lost.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// On the other hand, since all merged block-level properties are stored on document nodes, all formating
    /// in the resulting document will be available for modification.
    /// </para>
    /// </remarks>
    Merge,
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Properties of parent blocks are imported to a special logical structure and are stored separately from
    /// document nodes.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// Only margins and borders of 'body', 'div', and 'blockquote' HTML elements are imported. Properties of each HTML
    /// element are stored individually.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// This mode allows to better preserve borders and margins seen in the HTML document and get better conversion
    /// results. The downside is that the resulting document gets harder to modify, since borders and margins stored
    /// in the logical structure are not available for editing.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// This mode mimics MS Word's behavior regarding import of block properties.
    /// </para>
    /// </remarks>
    Preserve
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: 
The new mode of import HTML block-level elements allows to better preserve borders and margins seen in the HTML document and get better conversion results.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
const string html = @"
<html>
    <div style='border:dotted'>
        <div style='border:solid'>
            <p>paragraph 1</p>
            <p>paragraph 2</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</html>";

HtmlLoadOptions loadOptions = new HtmlLoadOptions();

// Set the new mode of import HTML block-level elements.
loadOptions.BlockImportMode = BlockImportMode.Preserve;
MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(html));
Document doc = new Document(stream, loadOptions);
doc.Save("sample.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Implemented chart legend entry API

Related issue: WORDSNET-23210.

The ChartLegendEntry and ChartLegendEntryCollection public classes have been implemented.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
namespace Aspose.Words.Drawing.Charts
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents a chart legend entry.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// A legend entry corresponds to a specific chart series or trendline.
    /// The text of the entry is the name of the series or trendline. The text cannot be changed.
    /// </remarks>
    public class ChartLegendEntry
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets a value indicating whether this entry is hidden in the chart legend.
        /// The default value is false.
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// When a chart legend entry is hidden, it does not affect the corresponding chart series or trendline that
        /// is still displayed on the chart.
        /// </remarks>
        public bool IsHidden { get; set; }
 
        /// <summary>
        /// Provides access to the font formatting of this legend entry.
        /// </summary>
        public Font Font { get; }
    }
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents a collection of chart legend entries.
    /// </summary>
    public class ChartLegendEntryCollection : IEnumerable<ChartLegendEntry>
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Returns the number of ChartLegendEntry in this collection.
        /// </summary>
        public int Count { get; }
 
        /// <summary>
        /// Returns ChartLegendEntry for the specified index.
        /// </summary>
        public ChartLegendEntry this[int index] { get; }
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The LegendEntries public property has been added to the ChartLegend class.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns a collection of legend entries for all series and trendlines of the parent chart.
/// </summary>
public ChartLegendEntryCollection LegendEntries { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

The LegendEntry public property has been added to the ChartSeries class.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets a legend entry for this chart series.
/// </summary>
public ChartLegendEntry LegendEntry { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

The constructor of the ChartLegend class has been marked obsolete. It will not be possible to create instances of this class.

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
 
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
 
Chart chart = shape.Chart;
ChartSeriesCollection series = chart.Series;

// Delete default generated series.
series.Clear();
 
string[] categories = new string[] { "AW Category 1", "AW Category 2" };
 
ChartSeries series1 = series.Add("Series 1", categories, new double[] { 1, 2 });
series.Add("Series 2", categories, new double[] { 3, 4 });
series.Add("Series 3", categories, new double[] { 5, 6 });
series.Add("Series 4", categories, new double[] { 0, 0 });
 
ChartLegendEntryCollection legendEntries = chart.Legend.LegendEntries;
legendEntries[3].IsHidden = true;
 
foreach (ChartLegendEntry legendEntry in legendEntries)
    legendEntry.Font.Size = 12;
 
series1.LegendEntry.Font.Italic = true;
 
doc.Save("output.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Document.UpdateTableLayout() method marked as obsolete

Related issue: WORDSNET-23539

UpdateTableLayout() method was an early attempt to reproduce MS Word logic for table column widths re-calculation without relying on table column widths stored data in the document.
The method was mostly intended as an alternative way to re-calculate table layouts when relying on the stored column widths caused incorrect results (e.g. for generated documents with incorrect column widths stored by Aspose.Words itself).
Though the method produced correct results for some cases, it never reproduced MS Word table layout logic entirely.
As a result, applying the method to an arbitrary document could often produce incorrect results for tables that were handled correctly by the default method relying on the stored column widths.

So after the method was recommended to a customer, we often started to get requests about incorrect table layouts after applying the method. The customers were frustrated because some tables were handled correctly only with UpdateTableLayout() and some were handled correctly only without UpdateTableLayout().

Since then, much effort was invested into reproducing MS Word table layout logic without relying on stored column widths.
It turned out that replacing the default logic for any arbitrary table and contents is not feasible. There are too many nuances with content metrics and different combinations of table/cell/container properties to take into account and be sure about the correct results.
So a limited approach was adopted when Aspose.Words only replaces stored column widths after checking that everything that can influence table layout of a specific table is supported by the re-calculation algorithm.
The class of the supported tables was widened significantly in release 22.2 and it will be further widened in the future.

As of now, the most common combinations of table content and table/cell properties are supported by the new approach. The new approach also replaces UpdateTableLayout() logic for the supported tables.
So currently UpdateTableLayout() may produce different results only for tables not supported by the new table layout logic.
As it is exactly the class of tables for which there are known issues with reproducing MS Word logic, it is highly likely that the correct table layout will not be produced by UpdateTableLayout() either.

Deprecating UpdateTableLayout() will clearly indicate that the method should not be used.
