## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added support for loading EPUB documents

Related issue: WORDSNET-8838

Aspose.Words now can load EPUB 2.0 documents.

EPUB is an e-book file format that uses the ".epub" file extension. A EPUB document is a collection of XHTML documents. Currently, Aspose.Words always loads all XHTML files from a EPUB document in the order in which they appear in the content file (OPF).

The following publicly visible enum values were added:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
FileFormat.Epub
LoadFormat.Epub
WarningSource.Epub
{{< /highlight >}}

The FileFormatUtil class can now be used to determine if a file is a EPUB document. For example, the following call
{{< highlight csharp >}}
FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat("book.epub");
{{< /highlight >}}

will return an info instance with the FileFormatInfo.LoadFormat property set to LoadFormat.Epub.
Of all load options only LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingCallback currently has effect when working with EPUB documents. It is useful for loading EPUB documents when the customer wants to control how external resources are loaded,

The use cases for loading EPUB documents are as follows:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("book.epub");
{{< /highlight >}}
or
{{< highlight csharp >}}
LoadOptions options = new LoadOptions
{
    ResourceLoadingCallback = new CustomResourceLoadingCallback();
};
Document doc = new Document("book.epub", options);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added support for loading XML documents

Related issue: WORDSNET-22697

Aspose.Words now can load XML documents.
The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple text-based format for representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, and much more.
Aspose.Words mimics MS Word behavior during import XML documents.

The following publicly visible enum value was added:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
LoadFormat.Xml
{{< /highlight >}}

The FileFormatUtil class can now be used to determine if a file is a XML document. For example, the following call
{{< highlight csharp >}}
FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat("sample.xml");
{{< /highlight >}}

will return an info instance with the FileFormatInfo.LoadFormat property set to LoadFormat.Xml.

The use cases for loading XML documents are as follows:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("sample.xml");
{{< /highlight >}}

###  Introduced ChapterPageSeparator enum and added PageSetup.ChapterPageSeparator and PageSetup.HeadingLevelForChapter properties

Related issue: WORDSNET-10869

The ChapterPageSeparator enum is introduced:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Defines the separator character that appears between the chapter and page number.
/// </summary>
/// <seealso cref="PageSetup"/>
/// <seealso cref="PageSetup.ChapterPageSeparator"/>
public enum ChapterPageSeparator
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A colon.
    /// </summary>
    Hyphen = 0,
    /// <summary>
    /// A period.
    /// </summary>
    Period = 1,
    /// <summary>
    /// A colon.
    /// </summary>
    Colon = 2,
    /// <summary>
    /// An emphasized dash.
    /// </summary>
    EmDash = 3,
    /// <summary>
    /// A standard dash.
    /// </summary>
    EnDash = 4
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The following public properties are added to PageSetup class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the heading level style that is applied to the chapter titles in the document.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Can be a number from 0 through 9. 0 means no chapter number if applied to page number.</p>
/// <p>Before you can create page numbers that include chapter numbers, the document headings must have a numbered outline format applied.</p>
/// </remarks>
public int HeadingLevelForChapter  { get; set; }
 
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the separator character that appears between the chapter number and the page number.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Before you can create page numbers that include chapter numbers, the document headings must have a numbered outline format applied.</p>
/// </remarks>
public ChapterPageSeparator ChapterPageSeparator { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(fileName);
 
PageSetup pageSetup = doc.FirstSection.PageSetup;
 
pageSetup.PageNumberStyle = NumberStyle.UppercaseRoman;
pageSetup.ChapterPageSeparator = ChapterPageSeparator.Colon;
pageSetup.HeadingLevelForChapter = 1;
{{< /highlight >}}

### LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingCallback is no longer invoked for data URLs

Related issue: WORDSNET-23535

LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingCallback is no longer invoked for resources that are embedded as data URLs (for example, data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAMQAAORH...). 
The reason is that these URLs do not reference external resources and are decoded in place.

### LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingCallback is no longer invoked for empty URLs

Related issue: WORDSNET-23677

LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingCallback is no longer invoked for empty URLs (for example, <img src=''>), because empty URLs don't reference any external resource.

### Slight changes in markup nodes typed collection

Related issue: WORDSNET-23774

The default indexer for markup nodes collection has been changed. Now it is the index number of a structured document tag in the collection.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns the structured document tag at the specified index.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="index">An index into the collection.</param>
public IStructuredDocumentTag this[int index] { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Along with this, it has become possible to remove a structured document tag at the specified index number, as well as remove a structured document tag by its identifier.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Removes the structured document tag with the specified identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="id">The structured document tag identifier.</param>
public void Remove(int id)
 
/// <summary>
/// Removes a structured document tag at the specified index.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="index">An index into the collection.</param>
public void RemoveAt(int index)
{{< /highlight >}}

The functionality that the indexer has previously performed by ID is now available through GetById() method.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns the structured document tag by identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Returns null if the structured document tag with the specified identifier cannot be found.</p>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="id">The structured document tag identifier.</param>
public IStructuredDocumentTag GetById(int id)
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
StructuredDocumentTags structuredDocumentTags = doc.Range.StructuredDocumentTags;
// We iterate through all collection elements, getting each element by its index number.
for (int i = 0; i < structuredDocumentTags.Count; i++)
{
    IStructuredDocumentTag sdt = structuredDocumentTags[i];
    Console.WriteLine(sdt.Title);
}
// Get the structured document tag by its Id.
sdt = structuredDocumentTags.GetById(1160505028);
if (sdt != null)
    Console.WriteLine(sdt.Title);   
// Remove the structured document tag by its Id.
structuredDocumentTags.Remove(1160505028);
// Remove the structured document tag at position 0.
structuredDocumentTags.RemoveAt(0);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added "Number10Envelope" value to PaperSize enum

Related issue: WORDSNET-23505

Added support of "Envelope No. 10" page size for printing.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies paper size.
/// </summary>
public enum PaperSize
{
   /// <summary>
   /// 4.125 x 9.5 inches.
   /// </summary>
   Number10Envelope
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
// This value is used to set the page size as follows:
Document doc = new Document(fileName);
doc.FirstSection.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSize.Number10Envelope;
 
// Or in a similar way using DocumentBuilder:
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSize.Number10Envelope;
{{< /highlight >}}

### HtmlSaveOptions.ExportTextBoxAsSvg was marked as obsolete

Related issue: WORDSNET-23514

The HtmlSaveOptions.ExportTextBoxAsSvg property is now obsolete. 
The customers should use the HtmlSaveOptions.ExportShapesAsSvg, which affects text boxes as well.
