## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new mode for import HTML block-level elements during inserting HTML via DocumentBuilder.InsertHtml() method

Related issue: WORDSNET-23654

New HTML insertion option was added to HtmlInsertOptions enum.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public enum HtmlInsertOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Preserve properties of block-level elements.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// By default, properties of parent blocks are merged and stored on their child elements (i.e. paragraphs or tables).
    /// If this option is specified, properties of each block are stored separately in a special logical structure.
    /// As a result, this option allows to better preserve individual borders and margins seen in the HTML document
    /// and get better conversion results. The downside is that the resulting document gets harder to modify, since borders
    /// and margins stored in the logical structure are not available for editing.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// Only margins and borders of 'body', 'div', and 'blockquote' HTML elements are preserved. Properties of each HTML
    /// element are stored separately.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// If this option is specified, Aspose.Words mimics MS Word's behavior regarding import of block properties.
    /// </para>
    /// </remarks>
    PreserveBlocks = 4
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The new mode of import HTML block-level elements during inserting HTML via DocumentBuilder.InsertHtml() method allows to better preserve borders and margins seen in the HTML document and get better conversion results.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
const string html = @"
<html>
    <div style='border:dotted'>
        <div style='border:solid'>
            <p>paragraph 1</p>
            <p>paragraph 2</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</html>";
// Set the new mode of import HTML block-level elements.
HtmlInsertOptions insertOptions = HtmlInsertOptions.PreserveBlocks;
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
builder.InsertHtml(html, insertOptions);
builder.Document.Save(MyDir + "sample.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public property ShadowFormat

Related issue: WORDSNET-23877

A new public ShadowFormat property has been added to ShapeBase class
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets shadow formatting for the shape.
/// </summary>
public ShadowFormat ShadowFormat { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

With this property customers can set or get one of the preset shadow types.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the specified <see cref="ShadowType"/> for ShadowFormat.
/// </summary>
public ShadowType Type { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Users can also get information about a shadow's visibility.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns <c>true</c> if the formatting applied to this instance is visible.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Unlike <see cref="Clear()"/>, assigning <c>false</c> to Visible does not clear the formatting,
/// it only hides the shape effect.
/// </remarks>
public bool Visible { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

And it is also possible to clear ShadowFormat.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Clears shadow format.
/// </summary>
public void Clear()
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document ("DocumentWithShape.docx");
Shape shape = doc.FirstSection.Body.Shapes[0];
// Checking whether the shadow effect is visible and whether the preset type is Shadow2.
if (shape.ShadowFormat.Visible && shape.ShadowFormat.ShapeType == ShapeType.Shadow2)
     // Setting the preset shadow type to Shadow7.
    shape.ShadowFormat.ShapeType = ShapeType.Shadow7;
// Checking whether the shadow is customized, i.e. the preset type is ShadowMixed.
if (shape.ShadowFormat.ShapeType == ShapeType.ShadowMixed)
     // Clearing ShadowFormat.
    shape.ShadowFormat.Clear();
{{< /highlight >}}
    
### ReportBuildOptions.RespectJpegExifOrientation enum member

Related issue: WORDSNET-23295

The following member has been added to the ReportBuildOptions enum:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies that the engine should use EXIF ​​image orientation values to appropriately rotate inserted
/// JPEG images.
/// </summary>
RespectJpegExifOrientation
{{< /highlight >}}

The option can be applied while building a report in the following way:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
ReportingEngine engine = new ReportingEngine();
engine.Options |= ReportBuildOptions.RespectJpegExifOrientation;
engine.BuildReport(...);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Supported the DATABASE field

Related issue: WORDSNET-15752

The following types and members have been added:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class FieldOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a provider that returns a query result for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field.
    /// </summary>
    public IFieldDatabaseProvider FieldDatabaseProvider { get; set; }
 
}
 
/// <summary>
/// Implement this interface to provide data for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field when it's updated.
/// </summary>
public interface IFieldDatabaseProvider
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns query result.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="fileName">The complete path and file name of the database specified in the \d field switch.</param>
    /// <param name="connection">The connection to the data specified in the \c field switch.</param>
    /// <param name="query">The set of SQL instructions that query the database specified in the \s field switch.</param>
    /// <param name="field">The field being updated.</param>
    /// <returns>The <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataTable"/> instance that should be used for the field's update.</returns>
    FieldDatabaseDataTable GetQueryResult(string fileName, string connection, string query, FieldDatabase field);
}
 
/// <summary>
/// Provides data for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field result.
/// </summary>
public class FieldDatabaseDataTable
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataTable"/> class.
    /// </summary>
    public FieldDatabaseDataTable(params string[] columnNames);
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets columns that belong to this table.
    /// </summary>
    public string[] ColumnNames { get; }
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets rows that belong to this table.
    /// </summary>
    public IList<FieldDatabaseDataRow> Rows { get; }
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataTable"/> class
    /// from the <see cref="System.Data.DataTable"/> instance.
    /// </summary>
    public static FieldDatabaseDataTable CreateFrom(System.Data.DataTable dataTable);
}
 
/// <summary>
/// Provides data for the <see cref="FieldDatabase"/> field result.
/// </summary>
public class FieldDatabaseDataRow
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataRow"/> class.
    /// </summary>
    public FieldDatabaseDataRow(params string[] values);
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets values that belong to this row.
    /// </summary>
    public string[] Values { get; }
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="FieldDatabaseDataRow"/> class
    /// from the <see cref="System.Data.DataRow"/> instance.
    /// </summary>
    public static FieldDatabaseDataRow CreateFrom(System.Data.DataRow dataRow);
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
document.FieldOptions.FieldDatabaseProvider = new OleDbFieldDatabaseProvider();
document.UpdateFields();
 
public class OleDbFieldDatabaseProvider : IFieldDatabaseProvider
{
    FieldDatabaseDataTable IFieldDatabaseProvider.GetQueryResult(string fileName, string connection, string query, FieldDatabase field)
    {
        OleDbConnectionStringBuilder connectionStringBuilder = new OleDbConnectionStringBuilder(connection);
        connectionStringBuilder.DataSource = fileName;
 
        using (OleDbConnection oleDbConnection = new OleDbConnection(connectionStringBuilder.ToString()))
        {
            OleDbDataAdapter oleDbDataAdapter = new OleDbDataAdapter(query, oleDbConnection);
            DataTable dataTable = new DataTable();
            oleDbDataAdapter.Fill(dataTable);
 
            return FieldDatabaseDataTable.CreateFrom(dataTable);
        }
    }
}
