## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 21.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Aspose.Words.Comparing namespace was introduced

Due to refactoring work on Aspose.Words namespaces, CompareOptions, ComparisonTargetType, Granularity classes were moved to new separate namespace Aspose.Words.Comparing.
In case of compilation error - please add using Aspose.Words.Comparing.

### Aspose.Words.Notes namespace was introduced

Due to refactoring work on Aspose.Words namespaces, Footnote, EndnoteOptions, FootnoteOptions, EndnotePosition, FootnotePosition, FootnoteType, FootnoteNumberingRule classes were moved to new separate namespace Aspose.Words.Notes.
In case of compilation error - please add using Aspose.Words.Notes.

### The classes related to load options were moved to Aspose.Words.Loading namespace

Due to refactoring work on Aspose.Words namespaces, LoadOptions, PdfLoadOptions, RtfLoadOptions, TxtLoadOptions classes and corresponding enums were moved to Aspose.Words.Loading namespace.
In case of compilation error - please add using Aspose.Words.Loading.

### Added a new public property CleanupOptions.UnusedBuiltinStyles

Related issue: WORDSNET-21977

Added a new public property to CleanupOptions:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies that unused BuiltIn styles should be removed from document.
/// </summary>
public bool UnusedBuiltinStyles { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use UnusedBuiltinStyles property.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
CleanupOptions cleanupOptions = new CleanupOptions();
cleanupOptions.UnusedBuiltinStyles = true;
doc.Cleanup(cleanupOptions);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Advanced typography supported when saving to images on .NET and .NET Standard

Related issue: WORDSNET-21330, WORDSNET-21991

Advanced typography is now supported when saving to images with GDI+ or SkiaSharp (i.e. on all .NET platforms and .NET Standard).

Use Case: Saving document to image with advanced typography features.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
doc.LayoutOptions.TextShaperFactory = HarfBuzzTextShaperFactory.Instance;
doc.Save("output.png");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Fill.Solid() method was introduced

Related issue: WORDSNET-21808

The following new public methods were added into the Fill class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Sets the fill to a uniform color.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use this method to convert any of the fills back to solid fill.
/// </remarks>
public void Solid()
 
/// <summary>
/// Sets the fill to a specified uniform color.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use this method to convert any of the fills back to solid fill.
/// </remarks>
public void Solid(Color color)
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to change fill to Solid.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
// Open some document with text effects.
Document doc = new Document("TextTwoColorGradient.docx");
 
// Get Fill object for Font of the first Run.
Fill fill = doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph.Runs[0].Font.Fill;
 
// Check Fill properties of the Font.
Console.WriteLine("The type of the fill is: {0}", fill.FillType);
Console.WriteLine("The foreground color of the fill is: {0}", fill.ForeColor);
Console.WriteLine("The fill is transparent at {0}%", fill.Transparency * 100);
 
// Change type of the fill to Solid with uniform green color.
fill.Solid(Color.Green);
Console.WriteLine("\nThe fill is changed:");
Console.WriteLine("The type of the fill is: {0}", fill.FillType);
Console.WriteLine("The foreground color of the fill is: {0}", fill.ForeColor);
Console.WriteLine("The fill transparency is {0}%", fill.Transparency * 100);
 
doc.Save("TextSolidOut.docx");
 
/*
This code example produces the following results:
 
The type of the fill is: Gradient
The foreground color of the fill is: Color [A=255, R=0, G=128, B=128]
The fill is transparent at 65%
 
The fill is changed:
The type of the fill is: Solid
The foreground color of the fill is: Color [A=255, R=0, G=128, B=0]
The fill transparency is 0%
*/

### Public API of Structured Document Tag range was extended

Related issue: WORDSNET-21246

The constructors for StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart and StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd classes have been made public. Now the instances of these classes can be created manually.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of the <b>Structured document tag range start</b> class.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>The following types of SDT can be created:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Checkbox"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.DropDownList"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.ComboBox"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Date"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.BuildingBlockGallery"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Group"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.Picture"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.RichText"/></item>
/// <item><see cref="Markup.SdtType.PlainText"/></item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="doc">The owner document.</param>
/// <param name="type">Type of SDT node.</param>
public StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart(DocumentBase doc, SdtType type)
 
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of the <b>Structured document tag range end</b> class.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="doc">The owner document.</param>
/// <param name="id">Identifier of the corresponding structured document tag range start.</param>
public StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd(DocumentBase doc, int id)
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
 
StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart start = new StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart(doc, SdtType.RepeatingSectionItem);
StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd end = new StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd(doc, start.Id);
 
doc.FirstSection.Body.InsertAfter(start, doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph);
doc.LastSection.Body.InsertBefore(end, doc.LastSection.Body.LastParagraph);
 
doc.Save("output.docx");
IEnumerable interface is implemented in StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart class for full LINQ support (i.e. Last(), LastOrDefault() and other methods).

Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart start = (StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart)doc.FirstSection.Body.GetChild(NodeType.StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart, 0, false);
 
Console.WriteLine(start.LastOrDefault().GetText());
{{< /highlight >}}

A new public RemoveAllChildren() method has been added.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Removes all the nodes between this range start node and the range end node.
/// </summary>
public void RemoveAllChildren()
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use RemoveAllChildren() method.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
 
int nodeCountBefore = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Any, true).Count;
StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart start = (StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart)doc.FirstSection.Body.GetChild(NodeType.StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart, 0, false);
start.RemoveAllChildren();
 
int nodeCountAfter = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Any, true).Count;
 
Console.WriteLine(nodeCountBefore);
Console.WriteLine(nodeCountAfter);
{{< /highlight >}}

A new public RemoveSelfOnly() method has been added.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Removes this range start and appropriate range end nodes of the structured document tag,
/// but keeps its content inside the document tree.
/// </summary>
public void RemoveSelfOnly()
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use RemoveSelfOnly() method.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart start = (StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart)doc.FirstSection.Body.GetChild(NodeType.StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart, 0, false);
start.RemoveSelfOnly();
{{< /highlight >}}

### Removed obsolete PdfSaveOptions.EscapeUri property

This option is not needed anymore because writing of URI to PDF was improved and cases when disabled escaping was required are handled well now.
