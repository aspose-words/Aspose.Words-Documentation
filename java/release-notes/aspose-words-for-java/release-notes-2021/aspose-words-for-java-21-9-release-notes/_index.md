## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 21.9. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new public property ListLevel.CustomNumberStyleFormat

Related issue: WORDSNET-22525

A new public property 'CustomNumberStyleFormat' has been added to the 'ListLevel' class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets the custom number style format for this list level. For example: "a, ç, ĝ, ...".
/// </summary>
public string CustomNumberStyleFormat
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:  Explains how to get the custom number style format for the list level.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("in.docx");
ListLevel listLevel = doc.FirstSection.Body.Paragraphs[0].ListFormat.ListLevel;
string customNumberStyleFormat = string.Empty;
if (listLevel.NumberStyle == NumberStyle.Custom)
    customNumberStyleFormat = listLevel.CustomNumberStyleFormat;
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new public static method ListLevel.GetEffectiveValue()

Related issue: WORDSNET-22525

A new public static method 'GetEffectiveValue()' has been added to the 'ListLevel' class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Reports the string representation of the <see cref="ListLevel"/> object for the specified index
/// of the list item. Parameters specify the <see cref="Words.NumberStyle"/> and an optional format string
/// used when <see cref="NumberStyle.Custom"/> is specified.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="index">The index of the list item (must be in the range from 1 to 32767).</param>
/// <param name="numberStyle">
/// The <see cref="Words.NumberStyle"/> of the <see cref="ListLevel"/> object.
/// </param>
/// <param name="customNumberStyleFormat">
/// The optional format string used when <see cref="NumberStyle.Custom"/> is specified (e.g. "a, ç, ĝ, ...").
/// In other cases, this parameter must be null or empty.
/// </param>
/// <returns>
/// The string representation of the <see cref="ListLevel"/> object, described by the numberStyle parameter and
/// the customNumberStyleFormat parameter, in the list item at the position determined by the index parameter.
/// </returns>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentException">
/// customNumberStyleFormat is null or empty when the numberStyle is custom.-or-
/// customNumberStyleFormat is not null or empty when the numberStyle is non-custom.-or-
/// customNumberStyleFormat is invalid.
/// </exception>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentOutOfRangeException">index is out of range.</exception>
public static string GetEffectiveValue(int index, NumberStyle numberStyle, string customNumberStyleFormat);
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to get the string representation of the ListLevel object for the specified index of the list item.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Assert.AreEqual("iv", ListLevel.GetEffectiveValue(4, NumberStyle.LowercaseRoman, null));
Assert.AreEqual("005", ListLevel.GetEffectiveValue(5, NumberStyle.Custom, "001, 002, 003, ..."));
{{< /highlight >}}
