## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 21.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.


### Added a new public property HtmlLoadOptions.IgnoreNoscriptElements

Related issue: WORDSNET-21203

Added a new public property HtmlLoadOptions.IgnoreNoscriptElements:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value indicating whether to ignore &lt;noscript&gt; HTML elements.
/// Default value is <c>false</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Like MS Word, Aspose.Words does not support scripts and by default loads content of &lt;noscript&gt; elements
/// into the resulting document. In most browsers, however, scripts are supported and content from &lt;noscript&gt;
/// is not visible. Setting this property to <c>true</c> forces Aspose.Words to ignore all &lt;noscript&gt; elements
/// and helps to produce documents that look closer to what is seen in browsers.
/// </remarks>
public bool IgnoreNoscriptElements { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Customers may now instruct Aspose.Words to ignore &lt;noscript&gt; HTML elements like most modern browsers do.

Use Case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
HtmlLoadOptions loadOptions = new HtmlLoadOptions();
loadOptions.IgnoreNoscriptElements = true;
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new public property Node.CustomNodeId

Related issue: WORDSNET-21203

Added a new public property Node.CustomNodeId:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies custom node identifier.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Default is zero.</p>
/// <p>This identifier can be set and used arbitrarily. For example, as a key to get external data.</p>
/// </remarks>
public int CustomNodeId { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Customers now may track node position in the model tree and bind external data based on assigned identifier:

Use Case: 

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
Shape shape = builder.InsertShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 100);
shape.CustomNodeId = 100;
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new public property TableStyle.VerticalAlignment

Related issue: WORDSNET-21114

Added a new public options that allows to set table style cell vertical alignment.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the vertical alignment for the cells.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The default value is <see cref="CellVerticalAlignment.Top"/>.
/// </remarks>
public CellVerticalAlignment VerticalAlignment { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: 

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = TestUtil.Open(fileName);
TableStyle style = (TableStyle)doc.Styles\["Custom Table 1"\];
style.VerticalAlignment = CellVerticalAlignment.Center;
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public methods StartColumnBookmark and EndColumnBookmark to DocumentBuilder class

Related issue: WORDSNET-18882

The following public methods have been added to the DocumentBuilder class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Marks the current position in the document as a column bookmark start. The position must be in a table cell.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>A column bookmark covers one or more columns in a range of rows. To create a valid bookmark you
/// need to call both <see cref="StartColumnBookmark"/> and <see cref="EndColumnBookmark"/> with the same
/// <b>bookmarkName</b> parameter.</p>
/// <p>Badly formed bookmarks or bookmarks with duplicate names will be ignored when the document is saved.</p>
/// <p>The actual position of the inserted <see cref="BookmarkStart"/> node may differ from the current document
/// builder position.</p>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="bookmarkName">Name of the bookmark.</param>
/// <returns>The bookmark start node that was just created.</returns>
public BookmarkStart StartColumnBookmark(string bookmarkName)
 
/// <summary>
/// Marks the current position in the document as a column bookmark end. The position must be in a table cell.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>A column bookmark covers one or more columns in a range of rows. To create a valid bookmark you
/// need to call both <see cref="StartColumnBookmark"/> and <see cref="EndColumnBookmark"/> with the same
/// <b>bookmarkName</b> parameter.</p>
/// <p>Badly formed bookmarks or bookmarks with duplicate names will be ignored when the document is saved.</p>
/// <p>The actual position of the inserted <see cref="BookmarkEnd"/> node may differ from the current document
/// builder position.</p>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="bookmarkName">Name of the bookmark.</param>
/// <returns>The bookmark end node that was just created.</returns>
public BookmarkEnd EndColumnBookmark(string bookmarkName)
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: 

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
 
builder.StartTable();
 
builder.InsertCell();
builder.StartColumnBookmark("Bookmark1");
builder.Write("Cell 1");
 
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Write("Cell 2");
 
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Write("Cell 3");
 
builder.EndRow();
 
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Write("Cell 4");
 
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Write("Cell 5");
builder.EndColumnBookmark("Bookmark1");
 
builder.InsertCell();
builder.Write("Cell 6");
 
builder.EndRow();
builder.EndTable();
 
doc.Save(dir + "out.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### MarkdownSaveOptions.ImageSavingCallback has been added to control how images are saved upon converting to Markdown format

Related issue: WORDSNET-21389

A new public property 'ImageSavingCallback' has been added to the 'MarkdownSaveOptions' class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to control how images are saved when a document is saved to <see cref="SaveFormat.Markdown"/> format.
/// </summary>
public IImageSavingCallback ImageSavingCallback
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: Explains how to use 'MarkdownSaveOptions.ImageSavingCallback' when saving a document to markdown format

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public void HandleDocument()
{
    const string outFileName = "SavingCallback.DocumentParts.Rendering.md";
 
    // Open a document to be converted to Markdown.
    Document doc = new Document("C:\\Rendering.docx");
 
    // We can use an appropriate SaveOptions subclass to customize the conversion process.
    MarkdownSaveOptions options = new MarkdownSaveOptions();
 
    // If we convert a document that contains images into Markdown, we will end up with one Markdown file which links to several images.
    // Each image will be in the form of a file in the local file system.
    // There is also a callback that can customize the name and file system location of each image.
    options.ImageSavingCallback = new SavedImageRename(outFileName);
 
    // The ImageSaving() method of our callback will be run at this time.
    doc.Save($"C:\\{outFileName}", options);
}

/// <summary>
/// Renames saved images that are produced when an Markdown document is saved.
/// </summary>
public class SavedImageRename : IImageSavingCallback
{
    public SavedImageRename(string outFileName)
    {
        mOutFileName = outFileName;
    }
 
    void IImageSavingCallback.ImageSaving(ImageSavingArgs args)
    {
        string imageFileName = $"{mOutFileName} shape {++mCount}, of type {args.CurrentShape.ShapeType}{Path.GetExtension(args.ImageFileName)}";
 
        args.ImageFileName = imageFileName;
        args.ImageStream = new FileStream($"C:\\{imageFileName}", FileMode.Create);
 
        Assert.True(args.ImageStream.CanWrite);
        Assert.True(args.IsImageAvailable);
        Assert.False(args.KeepImageStreamOpen);
    }
 
    private int mCount;
    private readonly string mOutFileName;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### PdfSaveOptions.EscapeUri is marked as obsolete

We made several improvements in export of hyperlinks to PDF per WORDSNET-21443. Now the cases when setting PdfSaveOptions.EscapeUri to false was required (improper unescaping of explicitly escaped URI delimiter chars) are handled well by default. Thus we do not see a reason to keep this option longer and marked it as obsolete.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// A flag specifying whether URI should be escaped before writing.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Note that if this option is set to <c>false</c> hyperlinks are written "as is",
/// so valid (escaped) URI should be provided in document's model.
/// <para>The default value is <c>true</c>.</para>
/// </remarks>
[Obsolete("Writing of URI to PDF was improved and cases when disabled escaping was required are handled well now.")]
public bool EscapeUri { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

### Removed obsolete properties FixedPageSaveOptions.PageIndex, FixedPageSaveOptions.PageCount, ImageSaveOptions.PageIndex, ImageSaveOptions.PageCount

Related issue: WORDSNET-21154

Deprecated properties related to page specification when printing were removed from the FixedPageSaveOptions and ImageSaveOptions classes.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
[Obsolete("This property is obsolete. Please use PageSet property instead.")]
public new int PageCount
[Obsolete("This property is obsolete. Please use PageSet property instead.")]
public new int PageIndex
{{< /highlight >}}

### The behavior of DocumentBuilder.InsertOleObject() and DocumentBuilder.InsertOleObjectAsIcon() methods was changed

Related issue: WORDSNET-21426

In cases where the DocumentBuilder.InsertOleObject() and DocumentBuilder.InsertOleObjectAsIcon() methods need to create an icon with a caption, they can use the file extension to define the icon, and can use the filename for the icon caption.

More details:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public Shape InsertOleObject(Stream stream, string progId, bool asIcon, Stream presentation)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'presentation' is omitted and 'asIcon' is set, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the predefined icon caption.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public Shape InsertOleObject(string fileName, bool isLinked, bool asIcon, Stream presentation)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'presentation' is omitted and 'asIcon' is set, this overloaded method selects the icon according to the file extension and uses the filename for the icon caption.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public Shape InsertOleObject(string fileName, string progId, bool isLinked, bool asIcon, Stream presentation)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'presentation' is omitted and 'asIcon' is set, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the filename for the icon caption.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public Shape InsertOleObjectAsIcon(Stream stream, string progId, string iconFile, string iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'iconFile' and 'iconCaption' are omitted, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the predefined icon caption.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public Shape InsertOleObjectAsIcon(string fileName, string progId, bool isLinked, string iconFile, string iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'iconFile' and 'iconCaption' are omitted, this overloaded method selects the icon according to 'progId' and uses the filename for the icon caption.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public Shape InsertOleObjectAsIcon(string fileName, bool isLinked, string iconFile, string iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}
If 'iconFile' and 'iconCaption' are omitted, this overloaded method selects the icon according to the file extension and uses the filename for the icon caption.

Changed XML comments for 'iconCaption' arguments of DocumentBuilder.InsertOleObjectAsIcon() methods:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Inserts an embedded or linked OLE object as icon into the document.
/// Allows to specify icon file and caption. Detects OLE object type using file extension.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="fileName">Full path to the file.</param>
/// <param name="isLinked">
/// If true then linked OLE object is inserted otherwise embedded OLE object is inserted.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconFile">
/// Full path to the ICO file. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use a predefined image.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconCaption">
/// Icon caption. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use the file name.
/// </param>
/// <returns>Shape node containing Ole object and inserted at the current Builder position.</returns>
public Shape InsertOleObjectAsIcon(string fileName, bool isLinked, string iconFile, string iconCaption)

/// <summary>
/// Inserts an embedded or linked OLE object as icon into the document.
/// Allows to specify icon file and caption. Detects OLE object type using given progID parameter.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="fileName">Full path to the file.</param>
/// <param name="progId">ProgId of OLE object.</param>
/// <param name="isLinked">
/// If true then linked OLE object is inserted otherwise embedded OLE object is inserted.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconFile">
/// Full path to the ICO file. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use a predefined image.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconCaption">
/// Icon caption. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use the file name.
/// </param>
/// <returns>Shape node containing Ole object and inserted at the current Builder position.</returns>

public Shape InsertOleObjectAsIcon(string fileName, string progId, bool isLinked, string iconFile, string iconCaption)
/// <summary>
/// Inserts an embedded OLE object as icon from a stream into the document.
/// Allows to specify icon file and caption. Detects OLE object type using given progID parameter.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="stream">Stream containing application data.</param>
/// <param name="progId">ProgId of OLE object.</param>
/// <param name="iconFile">
/// Full path to the ICO file. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use a predefined image.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconCaption">
/// Icon caption. If the value is null, Aspose.Words will use the a predefined icon caption.
/// </param>
/// <returns>Shape node containing Ole object and inserted at the current Builder position.</returns>
public Shape InsertOleObjectAsIcon(Stream stream, string progId, string iconFile, string iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}

### The behavior of revision tracking feature triggered by Document.StartTrackRevisions was changed

Related issue: WORDSNET-20666

When revisions are tracked using Document.StartTrackRevisions, if a node is moved from one location to another in the same document, move revisions are now generated, including move-from and move-to ranges.

Use Case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
 
// Generate document contents.
builder.Writeln("Paragraph 1");
builder.Writeln("Paragraph 2");
builder.Writeln("Paragraph 3");
builder.Writeln("Paragraph 4");
builder.Writeln("Paragraph 5");
builder.Writeln("Paragraph 6");
 
Body body = doc.FirstSection.Body;
 
// Returns 7.
Console.WriteLine("Paragraph count: {0}", body.Paragraphs.Count);
 
doc.StartTrackRevisions("Author", new DateTime(2020, 12, 23, 14, 0, 0));
 
Node node = body.Paragraphs[3];
Node endNode = body.Paragraphs[5].NextSibling;
Node referenceNode = body.Paragraphs[0];
 
while (node != endNode)
{
    Node nextNode = node.NextSibling;
    body.InsertBefore(node, referenceNode);
    node = nextNode;
}
 
doc.StopTrackRevisions();
 
// Returns 10: there are 3 additional paragraphs in the move-from range.
Console.WriteLine("Paragraph count: {0}", body.Paragraphs.Count);
 
doc.Save(dir + @"out.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}
