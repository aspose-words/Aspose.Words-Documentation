## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 16.5.0. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### WORDSNET-13538 - Added ReportingEngine.BuildReport() overload

The following overload has been added to the ReportingEngine class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Populates the specified template document with data from the specified sources making it a ready report.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Using this overload you can reference multiple data source objects and their members in the template.
/// The name of the first data source can be omitted (i.e. be an empty string or null) if you are going to
/// reference the data source's members but not the data source object itself. Names of the other data sources
/// must be specified and unique.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// If you are going to use a single data source, consider using of <see cref="BuildReport(Document, object)"/>
/// and <see cref="BuildReport(Document, object, string)"/> overloads instead.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="document">A template document to be populated with data.</param>
/// <param name="dataSources">An array of data source objects.</param>
/// <param name="dataSourceNames">An array of names to reference the data source objects within the template.</param>
public void BuildReport(Document document, object[] dataSources, string[] dataSourceNames)
{{< /highlight >}}

It allows using multiple data source objects while building a report.
