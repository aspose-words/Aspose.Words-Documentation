## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 16.4.0. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Field.Update() Overload Added

In order to fix WORDSNET-13094, we decided to introduce a way to update a field ignoring the MERGEFORMAT switch. We have added following overload:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public void update(boolean ignoreMergeFormat)
{{< /highlight >}}
