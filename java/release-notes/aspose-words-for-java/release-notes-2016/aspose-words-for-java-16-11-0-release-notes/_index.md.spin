## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 16.11.0. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### WORDSNET-3498 Support export to HTML5

#### New public enum HtmlVersion:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Indicates the version of HTML is used when saving the document to <see cref="SaveFormat.Html"/> and 
/// <see cref="SaveFormat.Mhtml"/> formats.
/// </summary>
public enum HtmlVersion
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Saves the document in compliance with the XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard. 
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <p>Aspose.Words aims to output XHTML according to the XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard, 
    /// but the output will not always validate against the DTD. Some structures inside a Microsoft Word 
    /// document are hard or impossible to map to a document that will validate against the XHTML schema. 
    /// For example, XHTML does not allow nested lists (UL cannot be nested inside another UL element), 
    /// but in Microsoft Word document multilevel lists occur quite often.</p>
    /// </remarks>
    Xhtml,
    /// <summary>
    /// Saves the document in compliance with the HTML 5 standard. 
    /// </summary>
    Html5
}
{{< /highlight >}}

#### New public property in HtmlSaveOptions:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies version of HTML standard that should be used when saving the document to HTML or MHTML.
/// Default value is <see cref="Saving.HtmlVersion.Xhtml"/>.
/// </summary>
public HtmlVersion HtmlVersion
{
     get { return mHtmlVersion; }
     set { mHtmlVersion = value; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Usecase:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
var so = new HtmlSaveOptions();
so.HtmlVersion = HtmlVersion.Html5;
doc.Save("out.html", so);
{{< /highlight >}}

### WORDSNET-13625 - FixedPageSaveOptions.OptimizeOutput

Starting from 16.11.0 version, OptimizeOutput option is available for all fixed page formats.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Flag indicates whether it is required to optimize output of XPS.
/// If this flag is set redundant nested canvases and empty canvases are removed,
/// also neighbor glyphs with the same formating are concatenated.
/// Note: The accuracy of the content display may be affected if this property is set to true.
///
/// Default is false.
/// </summary>
public virtual bool OptimizeOutput
{
    get { return mOptimizeOutput; }
    set { mOptimizeOutput = value; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}
