## Major Features

There are 75 improvements and fixes in this regular monthly release. The most notable are:

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 18.4. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose. Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Public Ref Class for out-ref Emulation in Public Java API

Related issue: WORDSJAVA-1756

On .NET baseline, some public API methods contain out/ref params in signatures. Service classes Ref&lt;T&gt;, RefInt, RefBoolean, etc. are added to emulate out/ref in Java.

Now, the code like:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
void SomeMethod(ref Document doc, out int i)
{{< /highlight >}}

is autoported to Java as:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
void someMethod(Ref<Document> doc, RefInt i)
{{< /highlight >}}

The Ref* classes contain get() and set() methods to get and set the value.

### Ability to Work with Password-Protected ODT and OTT File Formats Added

Related issue: WORDSNET-16133

Supported encryption for ODF documents.

The following public API has been added to the OdtSaveOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of this class that can be used to save a document in the <see cref="Words.SaveFormat.Odt"/> format
/// encrypted with a password.
/// </summary>
public OdtSaveOptions(String password)
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a password to encrypt document.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>In order to save document without encryption this property should be null or empty string.</para>
/// </remarks>
public String Password
{{< /highlight >}}

#### UC1: Load encrypted ODT document.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("\\encrypted.odt", new LoadOptions("password"));
{{< /highlight >}}

**UC2: Save ODT document encrypted with a password.**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
doc.save("\\encryped.odt", new OdtSaveOptions("password"));
{{< /highlight >}}

##### UC3: Verify ODT document is encrypted.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
FileFormatInfo info = FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat("\\encryped.odt");
System.out.println(info.isEncrypted());
{{< /highlight >}}

### Ability to Preserve PaperTray Information in PCL Added

Related issue: WORDSNET-16391

Paper tray information is now preserved when saving document to PCL format.
Following information is transferred from document's model to PCL file:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
PageSetup.FirstPageTray
PageSetup.OtherPagesTray
{{< /highlight >}}

No additional code is required.
Please note the value of paper tray is passed from document "as is".
PCL format supports only 8-bit identifiers for paper tray so make sure this values are correct for PCL printer.

### Added ShapeBase.IsLayoutInCell property

Related issue: WORDSNET-16546

The following public property has been added into the **ShapeBase** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a flag indicating whether the shape is displayed inside a table or outside of it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The default value is <b>true</b>.
/// Has effect only for top level shapes, the property <see cref="WrapType"/> of which is set to value
/// other than <see cref="WrapType.Inline"/>.
/// </remarks>
public boolean isLayoutInCell
{
    get; set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The property may be helpful for shapes (mainly VML) that are placed into a table cell but are needed to position without binding to the cell.

#### Usage

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "LayoutInCell.docx");
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
Shape watermark = new Shape(doc, ShapeType.TEXT_PLAIN_TEXT);
watermark.setRelativeHorizontalPosition(RelativeHorizontalPosition.PAGE);
watermark.setRelativeVerticalPosition(RelativeVerticalPosition.PAGE);
watermark.isLayoutInCell(false);
 // Display the shape outside of table cell if it will be placed into a cell.
watermark.setWidth(300);
watermark.setHeight(70);
watermark.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.CENTER);
watermark.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.CENTER);
watermark.setRotation(-40);
watermark.getFill().setColor(Color.GRAY);
watermark.setStrokeColor(Color.GRAY);
watermark.getTextPath().setText("watermarkText");
watermark.getTextPath().setFontFamily("Arial");
watermark.setName("WaterMark_0");
watermark.setWrapType(WrapType.NONE);
Run run = (Run) doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.RUN, true).get(doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.RUN, true).getCount() - 1);
builder.moveTo(run);
builder.insertNode(watermark);
doc.getCompatibilityOptions().optimizeFor(MsWordVersion.WORD_2010);

// Save the document to disk.
dataDir = dataDir + "Shape_IsLayoutInCell_out.docx";
doc.save(dataDir);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Optimization of Vector Graphics Output of Metafile Rendering

Related issues: WORDSNET-16449, WORDSNET-15490

Implemented optimization of metafile rendering vector output. Optimization includes applying intermediate transformations directly to the graphics and removing redundant canvases. Such optimization is also performed by MW when saving metafiles as vector graphics to PDF, XPS, etc.

Optimization may affect the visual appearance of metafile vector graphics in viewer applications due to peculiarities of vector graphics rendering. For example, there are cases when not optimized output looks faded out in Acrobat Reader comparing to optimized output.

Metafile output optimization is controlled by existing FixedPageSaveOptions.OptimizeOutput flag.

### Obsolete property LoadOptions.WebRequestTimeout was removed

Obsolete property WebRequestTimeout was removed from the LoadOptions class. Please use the HtmlLoadOptions.WebRequestTimeout property instead.
