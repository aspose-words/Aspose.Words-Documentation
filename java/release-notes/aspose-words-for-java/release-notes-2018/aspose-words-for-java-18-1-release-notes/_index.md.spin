## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 18.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose. Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Enhanced Support of Single-Column Table Data Bands and Conditional Blocks for LINQ Reporting Engine

Related issues WORDSNET-13863, WORDSNET-15776, WORDSNET-16188.

The "[Working with Table-Row Data Bands](/words/java/working-with-table-row-data-bands/)" and "[Working with Table-Row Conditional Blocks](/words/java/working-with-table-row-conditional-blocks/)" sections of the engine's documentation were updated to describe the change.

### Remove Obsolete Method in CompositeNode

Removed obsolete public method from CompositeNode class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public NodeCollection getChildNodes(NodeType nodeType, boolean isDeep, boolean isLive)
{{< /highlight >}}

Parameter "isLive" is not used anymore. Please use CompositeNode.GetChildNodes(NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep) instead.

### Added the ChartAxis.Hidden Property

Related Issue: WORDSNET-15801

The following public property has been added into the **ChartAxis** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a flag indicating whether this axis is hidden or not.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Default value is false.
/// </remarks>
public boolean Hidden
{
    get; set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The property allows hiding/showing and getting visibility state of an axis of a chart.

#### UC to create a chart and hide its Y axis

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert chart.
Shape shape = builder.insertChart(ChartType.COLUMN, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.getChart();

// Clear demo data.
chart.getSeries().clear();

// Fill data.
chart.getSeries().add("AW Series 1",
        new String[] { "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5" },
        new double[] { 1.2, 0.3, 2.1, 2.9, 4.2 });

// Hide the Y axis.
chart.getAxisY().setHidden(true);
dataDir = dataDir + "HideChartAxis_out.docx";
doc.save(dataDir);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Property for Preserving Meta-Characters during Replacement

Related Issue: WORDSNET-15840

We have added public get/set property for preserving meta-characters during replacement as an option in FindReplaceOptions class

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// True indicates that meta-characters beginning with "&" are preserved.
/// Default value is false.
/// </summary>
public boolean PreserveMetaCharacters
{{< /highlight >}}

This is useful for example in replacing html text with meta-characters such as "&ldquo" and others

Sample usage

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = Utils.getSharedDataDir(ReplaceTextWithField.class) + "FindAndReplace/";
String html = "<p>&ldquo;Some Text&rdquo;</p>";

// Initialize a Document.
Document doc = new Document();

// Use a document builder to add content to the document.
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.write("{PLACEHOLDER}");
FindReplaceOptions findReplaceOptions = new FindReplaceOptions();
findReplaceOptions.setReplacingCallback(new FindAndInsertHtml());
findReplaceOptions.setPreserveMetaCharacters(true);
doc.getRange().replace("{PLACEHOLDER}", html, findReplaceOptions);
dataDir = dataDir + "ReplaceHtmlTextWithMetaCharacters_out.doc";
doc.save(dataDir);
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
static class FindAndInsertHtml implements IReplacingCallback {
    public int replacing(ReplacingArgs e) throws Exception {
        // This is a Run node that contains either the beginning or the complete match.
        Node currentNode = e.getMatchNode();

        // create Document Buidler and insert MergeField
        DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder((Document) e.getMatchNode().getDocument());
        builder.moveTo(currentNode);
        builder.insertHtml(e.getReplacement());
        currentNode.remove();
        //Signal to the replace engine to do nothing because we have already done all what we wanted.
        return ReplaceAction.SKIP;
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Feature to Get StoreItemID Property of StructuredDocumentTag

Related Issue: WORDSNET-16060

As per customer's request, we have made public get property StoreItemId of class XmlMapping:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies the custom XML data identifier for the custom XML data part which
/// shall be used to evaluate the <see cref="XPath"/> expression.
/// </summary>
public String StoreItemId
{{< /highlight >}}

More info about storeItemID property: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.databinding(v=office.14).aspx>

Sample usage:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("file.docx");
StructuredDocumentTag sdt = (StructuredDocumentTag) doc.getChild(NodeType.STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT_TAG, 0, true);
System.out.println("Id = " + sdt.getXmlMapping().getStoreItemId());
{{< /highlight >}}
