## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 18.8. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose. Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Nested Reports are Supported by LINQ Reporting Engine

WORDSNET-16817 has now been resolved.

The "[Inserting Documents Dynamically](/words/java/inserting-documents-dynamically/)" section of the engine's documentation was updated to describe the change.

### Added Feature to Create Snip Corner Rectangle

WORDSNET-13967 has been resolved:

The following shapes types were added to the "ShapeType" enum:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// Snip single corner rectangle object.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Applicable only for DML shapes.
/// </remarks>
SingleCornerSnipped = 203,
/// <summary>
/// Snip same side corner rectangle.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Applicable only for DML shapes.
/// </remarks>
TopCornersSnipped = 204,
/// <summary>
/// Snip diagonal corner rectangle.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Applicable only for DML shapes.
/// </remarks>
DiagonalCornersSnipped = 205,
/// <summary>
/// Snip and round single corner rectangle.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Applicable only for DML shapes.
/// </remarks>
TopCornersOneRoundedOneSnipped = 206,
/// <summary>
/// Round single corner rectangle.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Applicable only for DML shapes.
/// </remarks>
SingleCornerRounded = 207,
/// <summary>
/// Round same side corner rectangle.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Applicable only for DML shapes.
/// </remarks>
TopCornersRounded = 208,
/// <summary>
/// Round diagonal corner rectangle.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Applicable only for DML shapes.
/// </remarks>
DiagonalCornersRounded = 209
{{< /highlight >}}

These shape types can not be used to create VML shapes. Attempt to create shape  by using public constructor of the "Shape" class raises the "NotSupportedException" exception. DML shape with one of specified above type can be created with "InsertShape" method of the document builder:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
Shape shape = builder.insertShape(ShapeType.TOP_CORNERS_SNIPPED, 50, 50);
OoxmlSaveOptions so = new OoxmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.DOCX);
so.setCompliance(OoxmlCompliance.ISO_29500_2008_TRANSITIONAL);
doc.save("TopCornersSnipped.docx", so);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Reference Resources in MHTML Documents using the "Content-Id" URL Scheme.

WORDSNET-16985 has been resolved.

By default, resources in MHTML documents are referenced by file name (for example, "image.png"), which are matched against "Content-Location" headers of MIME parts.
Now was added a new option to HtmlSaveOptions. This option enables an alternative method, where references to resource files are written as CID (Content-ID) URLs (for example, "[cid:image.png](http://cidimage.png)") and are matched against "Content-ID" headers.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public boolean ExportCidUrlsForMhtmlResources { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Public Property ShowComments in LayoutOptions

WORDSNET-16986 has been resolved.

The following property has been added to the LayoutOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets indication of whether comments are rendered.
/// Default is True.
/// </summary>
public boolean ShowComments
{
   get; set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This property is used to show\hide comments in the output document. By default, the comments are always shown.

**Usage**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(myDir + "Input.docx");
doc.getLayoutOptions().setShowComments(false);
doc.save(myDir + "Output.pdf");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Public Property ShowInBalloons in RevisionOptions

WORDSNET-16986 has been resolved.

The following property has been added to the RevisionOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to specify whether the revisions are rendered in the balloons.
/// Default value for this property is <see cref="Layout.ShowInBalloons.None"/>
/// </summary>
public ShowInBalloons ShowInBalloons
{
      get; set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies which revisions are rendered in balloons.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Note that these values do not affect rendering of comments, which are controlled by <see cref="LayoutOptions.ShowComments"/>.
/// </remarks>
public enum ShowInBalloons
{
     /// <summary>
     /// Renders insert, delete and format revisions inline.
     /// </summary>
     None,
     /// <summary>
     /// Renders insert and delete revisions inline, format revisions in balloons.
     /// </summary>
     Format,
     /// <summary>
     /// Renders insert revisions inline, delete and format revisions in balloons.
     /// </summary>
     FormatAndDelete,
}
{{< /highlight >}}

This property is used to show revisions in the balloons. By default, the revisions in balloons are not shown.

**Usage:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(myDir + "Input.docx");

// Renders insert and delete revisions inline, format revisions in balloons.
doc.getLayoutOptions().getRevisionOptions().setShowInBalloons(ShowInBalloons.FORMAT);
doc.save(myDir + "Output.pdf");
{{< /highlight >}}

Or

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(myDir + "Input.docx");

// Renders insert revisions inline, delete and format revisions in balloons.
doc.getLayoutOptions().getRevisionOptions().setShowInBalloons(ShowInBalloons.FORMAT_AND_DELETE);
doc.save(myDir + "Output.pdf");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Write all CSS Declarations of HtmlFixed Documents into Single File

WORDSNET-17089 has been resolved.

Previously, Aspose.Words saved "@font-face" rules of HtmlFixed documents into a separate file "fontFaces.css" while other CSS declarations were written to "styles.css". We have changed this behavior and now Aspose.Words saves all CSS rules and declarations into the same file "styles.css". In case the old behavior is required for compatibility with legacy code, it can be restored by using the new public property that we have added to the HtmlFixedSaveOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
boolean SaveFontFaceCssSeparately { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

### RtfLoadOptions class was extended

WORDSNET-17184 has been resolved.

A new LoadOptions class for dealing with RTF files was introduced : ***RtfLoadOptions***.

New public property ***RecognizeUtf8Text*** was added into the RtfLoadOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// <para> When set to true, <see cref="CharsetDetector"/> will try to detect UTF8 characters,
/// they will be preserved during import.
/// </para>
/// Default value is false.
/// </summary>
public boolean RecognizeUtf8Text
{{< /highlight >}}

This property allows to detect UTF-8 encoded characters and preserve them during import.

UC:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
RtfLoadOptions loadOptions = new RtfLoadOptions();
loadOptions.setRecognizeUtf8Text(true);
Document doc = new Document(fileName, loadOptions);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Obsolete Member NumInDash was Removed from NumberStyle Enum

Obsolete value NumInDash was removed from NumberStyle enum. Please, use NumberStyle.NumberInDash value instead.

### Obsolete Method ToTxt() was Removed from Node Class

Obsolete method ToTxt() was removed from Node class. Please, use ToString(SaveFormat.Text) instead.

### Obsolete Property Location was Removed from FootnoteOptions and EndnoteOptions Classes

The obsolete property Location has been removed from the FootnoteOptions and EndnoteOptions classes. Please use the Position property. Also, the FootnoteLocation emum type has been removed.

### Obsolete Property WarningCallback  was Removed from SaveOptions Class

Obsolete property WarningCallback  was removed from SaveOptions class. Please, use the Document.WarningCallback property instead.
