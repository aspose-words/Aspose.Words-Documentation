## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.


### Added a new public property VbaProject.IsSigned

Related issue: WORDSNET-12444 Added a new public property VbaProject.IsSigned:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Shows whether the VbaProject is signed or not.
/// </summary>
public bool IsSigned
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(@"source.docm"); 
if (doc.VbaProject.IsSigned)
 
 // do smth..
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added setters for floating table properties

WORDSNET-12204. Added setters for following table properties: RelativeHorizontalAlignment, AbsoluteHorizontalDistance, RelativeVerticalAlignment, AbsoluteVerticalDistance.

These properties allow setting floating table position.

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Note that this is combined property, i.e setting RelativeHorizontalAlignment will reset AbsoluteHorizontalDistance to the default value and vice versa. The same is for vertical positioning.

{{% /alert %}} 



Use Case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("some doc"); 
Table table = document.FirstSection.Body.Tables\[0\];
table.AbsoluteHorizontalDistance = 10;
 // sets absolute table horizontal position at 10pt.
table.RelativeVerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center;
 // sets vertical table position to center of entity specified by Table.VerticalAnchor.
{{< /highlight >}}

### SaveOptions.ColorMode property moved to FixedPageSaveOptions class

Related issue: WORDSNET-19635 SaveOptions.ColorMode public property moved to FixedPageSaveOptions class.

### Supported dynamic bookmark insertion for LINQ Reporting Engine

Issue: WORDSNET-19648 The "[Inserting Bookmarks Dynamically](/words/java/inserting-bookmarks-dynamically/)" section of the engine's documentation was added to describe the change.

### WORDSNET-18928 - Add feature to insert IconCaption and correct icon while using InsertOleObject

A new public method has been added to the DocumentBuilder class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Inserts an embedded or linked OLE object as icon into the document. 
/// Allows to specify icon file and caption. Detects OLE object type using file extension. 
/// </summary>
/// <param name="fileName">Full path to the file.</param>
/// <param name="isLinked">
/// If true then linked OLE object is inserted otherwise embedded OLE object is inserted.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconFile">
/// Full path to the ICO file. 
/// If the value is null or the ICO file is not readable, Aspose.Words will use a predefined image.
/// </param>
/// <param name="iconCaption">Icon caption.</param>
/// <returns>Shape node containing Ole object and inserted at the current Builder position.</returns>
public Shape InsertOleObjectAsIcon(string fileName, bool isLinked, string iconFile, string iconCaption)
{{< /highlight >}}



Use Case. Explains how to inserts an embedded or linked OLE object as an icon into the document:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
Shape shape = builder.InsertOleObjectAsIcon("C:\\embedded.xlsx", false, "C:\\icon.ico", "My embedded file");
doc.Save("C:\\output.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}
