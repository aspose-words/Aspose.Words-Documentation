## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new public property MailMerge.RetainFirstSectionStart

Related issue: WORDSNET-20480

Added a new public property MailMerge.RetainFirstSectionStart:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/ <summary>
 /// Gets or sets a value indicating whether the <see cref="PageSetup.SectionStart"/> of the first document section and its copies for subsequent data source rows
 /// are retained during mail merge or updated according to MS Word behaviour.
 /// </summary>
 /// <remarks>
 /// The default value is <b>true</b>.
 /// </remarks>
 public bool RetainFirstSectionStart { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
cument document = new Document(path);
 document.MailMerge.RetainFirstSectionStart = false;
 document.MailMerge.Execute(dataSource);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new value to public enumeration WarningSource

Related issue: WORDSNET-20334

A new value is added to the public enumeration WarningSource:

**.NET**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
 /// Module that reads/writes Markdown files.
 /// </summary>
 Markdown
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case. Explains how to use WarningSource.Markdown enumeration value:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
 Document doc = TestUtil.Open("input.docx");
 WarningInfoCollection warnings = new WarningInfoCollection();
 doc.WarningCallback = warnings;
 doc.Save("output.md");
 foreach (WarningInfo warningInfo in warnings)
 {
    if (warningInfo.Source == WarningSource.Markdown)
        Console.WriteLine(warningInfo.Description);
 }
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property MeasurementUnit in RevisionOptions

Related issue: WORDSNET-20487

Added a new public property RevisionOptions.MeasurementUnit:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
 /// Allows to specify the measurement unit for revision comments.
 /// Default value for this property is <see cref="MeasurementUnits.Centimeters"/>
 /// </summary>
 public MeasurementUnits MeasurementUnit
{{< /highlight >}}

Also, a new public enumeration has been added:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
 /// Specifies a the unit of measurement.
 /// </summary>
 public enum MeasurementUnits
 {
    /// <summary>
    /// Inches.
    /// </summary>
    Inches = 0,
    /// <summary>
    /// Centimeters.
    /// </summary>
    Centimeters = 1,
    /// <summary>
    /// Millimeters.
    /// </summary>
    Millimeters = 2,
    /// <summary>
    /// Points.
    /// </summary>
    Points = 3,
    /// <summary>
    /// Picas (commonly used in traditional typewriter font spacing).
    /// </summary>
    Picas = 4
 }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(myDir +"Input.docx");
 doc.LayoutOptions.RevisionOptions.MeasurementUnit = MeasurementUnits.Inches;
 doc.LayoutOptions.RevisionOptions.ShowInBalloons = ShowInBalloons.FormatAndDelete;
 doc.LayoutOptions.ShowComments = true;
 doc.Save(myDir +"Output.pdf");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property RevisionBarsPosition in RevisionOptions

Related issue: WORDSNET-20415, WORDSNET-19724

Added a new public property RevisionOptions.RevisionBarsPosition:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
 /// Gets or sets rendering position of revision bars.
 /// Default value is <see cref="HorizontalAlignment.Outside"/>.
 /// </summary>
 /// <remarks>Values of <see cref="HorizontalAlignment.Center"/> and <see cref="HorizontalAlignment.Inside"/>
 /// are not allowed and will cause <see cref="ArgumentOutOfRangeException"/>.</remarks>
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
 Document doc = new Document(myDir +"Input.docx");
 //Renders revision bars on the right side of a page.
 doc.LayoutOptions.RevisionOptions.RevisionBarsPosition = HorizontalAlignment.Right;
 doc.Save(myDir +"Output.pdf");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added two new nodes to handle multi-section Structured Document Tags

Related issue: WORDSNET-15659

Added new nodes to handle multi-section structured document tags.

The following classes have been added:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Specifies the PDF standards compliance level. 
 public class StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart : Node
 {
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the type of this node.
    /// </summary>
    public NodeType NodeType { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the level at which this <b>SDT range start</b> occurs in the document tree.
    /// </summary>
    public MarkupLevel Level { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets type of this <b>Structured document tag</b>.
    /// </summary>
    public SdtType SdtType { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// <para>Specifies a unique read-only persistent numerical Id for this <b>SDT</b>.</para>
    /// </summary>
    public int Id { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// When set to true, this property will prohibit a user from deleting this <b>SDT</b>.
    /// </summary>
    public bool LockContentControl { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// When set to true, this property will prohibit a user from editing the contents of this <b>SDT</b>.
    /// </summary>
    public bool LockContents { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies whether the content of this <b>SDT</b> shall be interpreted to contain placeholder text
    /// (as opposed to regular text contents within the SDT).
    /// </summary>
    public bool IsShowingPlaceholderText { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies a tag associated with the current SDT node.
    /// </summary>
    public string Tag { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies the friendly name associated with this <b>SDT</b>.
    /// </summary>
    public string Title { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies end of range if the StructuredDocumentTag is a ranged structured document tag.
    /// </summary>
    public StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd RangeEnd { get; }
 }
 public class StructuredDocumentTagRangeEnd : Node
 {
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the type of this node.
    /// </summary>
    public NodeType NodeType { get; }
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies a unique read-only persistent numerical Id for this structured document tag node.
    /// Corresponding range start node has the same Id.
    /// </summary>
    public int Id { get; }
 }
{{< /highlight >}}

NOTE: These nodes can be a child of NodeType.Body node only.

NOTE: So far all properties of these nodes are read-only and nodes itself cannot be created by customers.

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
cument doc = new Document("document containing multi-section SDT");List<StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart> tags =
                doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart, true).ToList<StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart>();
  foreach(StructuredDocumentTagRangeStart tag in tags)
    Console.WriteLine(tag.Title);
{{< /highlight >}}
