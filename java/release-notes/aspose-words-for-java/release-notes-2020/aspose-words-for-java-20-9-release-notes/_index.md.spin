## Major Features

There are 86 improvements and fixes in this regular monthly release. The most notable are:

- Culture/Locale tables are synchronized with Windows/.NET now. So, now we can read/write Windows-generated documents with "strange" Cultures: Pseudo, Invariant, de-De with Phone sort, Chinese with Bopomofo sort, etc.
- VbaReferenceCollection and related types are exposed publicly.
- Implemented support of footnotes upon loading PDF documents.
- Implemented rendering of metafiles with EMF+ containers.
- The FormField font formatting API was extended.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.9. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Changed the behavior of the FormField.Font property

Related issue: WORDSNET-522
Changed the behavior of the 'FormField.Font' property.
It is currently allowed to apply font formatting to the FormField as a whole.
When new Font properties are set, they take effect for the entire FormField, including the field value.

Use Case. Explains how to apply font formatting to the FormField as a whole:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("in.doc");
doc.Range.FormFields[0].Font.Size = 20;
doc.Range.FormFields[0].Font.Color = Color.Red;
doc.Save("out.doc");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Deprecated find replace algorithm returned for compatibility reason

Related issue: WORDSNET-21018
Following member has been added to FindReplaceOptions class
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a boolean value indicating that old find/replace algorithm is used.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Use this flag if you need exactly the same behavior as before advanced find/replace feature was introduced.
/// Note that old algorithm does not support advanced features such as replace with breaks, apply formatting and so on.
/// </remarks>
public bool LegacyMode { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

### VbaReferenceCollection and related types are exposed publicly

Related issue: WORDSNET-13678

Implemented a new VbaReferenceCollection class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Represents a collection of <see cref="VbaReference"/> objects.
/// </summary>
public sealed class VbaReferenceCollection : IEnumerable<VbaReference>
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Removes the first occurrence of a specified VbaReference item from the collection. 
	/// </summary>
	public void Remove(VbaReference item)

	/// <summary>
	/// Removes the VbaReference element at the specified index of the collection. 
	/// </summary>
	public void RemoveAt(int index)

	/// <summary>
	/// Returns the number of VBA references in the collection.
	/// </summary>
	public int Count
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Implemented a new VbaReference class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Implements a reference to an Automation type library or VBA project.
/// </summary>
public abstract class VbaReference
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Gets <see cref="VbaReferenceType"/> object that indicates the type of reference that a VbaReference object represents.
	/// </summary>
	public abstract VbaReferenceType Type { get; }

	/// <summary>
	/// Gets a string value containing the identifier of an Automation type library.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Depending on reference type, the value of this property can be:
	/// <list type="bullet">
	/// <item>a LibidReference specified at 2.1.1.8 LibidReference of [MS-OVBA]:
	/// >
	/// <item>a ProjectReference specified at 2.1.1.12 ProjectReference of [MS-OVBA]:
	/// >
	/// </list>
	/// </remarks>
	public abstract string LibId { get; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Implemented a new public enum VbaReferenceType:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to specify the type of a <see cref="VbaReference"/> object.
/// </summary>
public enum VbaReferenceType
{{< /highlight >}}

Added a new public property into VbaProject class:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets a collection of VBA project references.
/// </summary>
public VbaReferenceCollection References
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case. Explains how to remove some reference from the collection of references of VbaProject:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public void Main()
{
    Document doc = new Document("test.doc");
 
    // Find and remove the reference with some LibId path.
    const string brokenPath = "brokenPath.dll";
    VbaReferenceCollection references = doc.VbaProject.References;
    for (int i = references.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        VbaReference reference = doc.VbaProject.References[i];
        string path = GetLibIdPath(reference);
        if (path == brokenPath)
            references.RemoveAt(i);
    }
 
    doc.Save("NoBrokenRef.doc"); 
}
 
/// <summary>
/// Returns string representing LibId path of a specified reference. 
/// </summary>
private static string GetLibIdPath(VbaReference reference)
{
    switch (reference.Type)
    {
        case VbaReferenceType.Registered:
        case VbaReferenceType.Original:
        case VbaReferenceType.Control:
            return GetLibIdReferencePath(reference.LibId);
        case VbaReferenceType.Project:
            return GetLibIdProjectPath(reference.LibId);
        default:
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException();
    }
}
 
/// <summary>
/// Returns path from a specified identifier of an Automation type library.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Please see details for the syntax at [MS-OVBA], 2.1.1.8 LibidReference. 
/// </remarks>
private static string GetLibIdReferencePath(string libIdReference)
{
    if (libIdReference != null)
    {
        string[] refParts = libIdReference.Split('#');
        if (refParts.Length > 3)
            return refParts[3];
    }
 
    return "";
}

/// <summary>
/// Returns path from a specified identifier of an Automation type library.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Please see details for the syntax at [MS-OVBA], 2.1.1.12 ProjectReference. 
/// </remarks>
private static string GetLibIdProjectPath(string libIdProject)
{
    return (libIdProject != null) ? libIdProject.Substring(3) : "";
}
{{< /highlight >}}
