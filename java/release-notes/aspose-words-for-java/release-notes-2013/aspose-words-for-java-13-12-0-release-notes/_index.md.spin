## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

The following is a list of any changes made to the public API such as added, renamed, removed or deprecated members as well as any non-backward compatible change made to Aspose.Words for .NET. If you have concerns about any change listed, please raise it on the Aspose.Words support forum.

### DrawingML.GetShapeRenderer Behavior Changed

In earlier versions Aspose.Words always used to use the fallback shape when rendering DrawingML as Aspose.Words was not able to properly render DrawingML. Fallback shapes are prerendered shapes included by Microsoft Word or the host program when the graphics object is created. The current version version can render DrawingMLs on almost the same level as VML Shapes so the behavior of this method has been switched to render the original DrawingML instead of fall back to VML rendering.h3. ExportEmbeddedSvg Property Added to HtmlFixedSaveOptions 

The ExportEmbeddedSvg boolean property has been added to HtmlFixedSaveOptions that controls how SVG resources are exported when a document is saved to fixed-page HTML.If the property is set to true (which is the default value) SVG resources are embedded in the HTML document, as before however if the property is set to false, SVG resources are saved to external files. The files are named "svg1.svg", "svg2.svg", etc and are placed next to other resource files of the document. If the user provides a callback using HtmlFixedSaveOptions.ResourceSavingCallback this callback will be called for each SVG file. As with images Aspose.Words remembers all SVG files already exported for the document and reuses them to prevent duplication.h3. FirstPageHeaderFooterPerSection Option Added to ExportHeadersFootersMode 

A new enumeration value of FirstPageHeaderFooterPerSection has been added to HtmlSaveOptions.ExportHeaderFootersMode that allows you to export first page headers and footers instead of primary headers and footers while exporting to HTML-based formats.h3. Rendering of DrawingML Glow Effect 

Starting from 13.12.0 version Aspose.Words supports rendering DrawingML glow effect. The glow effect can be rendered in one of three modes: 

- Simplified (default) - Soft edges are simulated using several layers with different transparency, which gives acceptable result with higher performance than in Fine mode.
- Fine - Blur filter is applied, which gives the same result as MS Word, but with lower performance because of complexity of convolution filter.
- None - In this mode no DrawingML effects are rendered.

The different modes can be set using new property: SaveOptions.DmlEffectsRenderingMode.h3. Rendering of DrawingML Glow Effect 

Starting from 13.12.0 version Aspose.Words supports rendering of outer shadow DrawingML effect. Effect can be rendered in two modes: 

### ResourceFileUri Property Added to ResourceSavingArgs

We have added ResourceSavingArgs.ResourceFileUri property that allows users to provide custom uniform resource identifiers (URI) for resources saved to external files during export to SVG and fixed-page HTML formats. When Aspose.Words calls an instance of IResourceSavingCallback provided by user the ResourceFileUricontains the URI generated by Aspose.Words for the resource file.The properties HtmlFixedSaveOptions.ResourcesFolderAlias and SvgSaveOptions.ResourcesFolderAlias already exist that modify URIs of external resources, but these properties have the following limitations: 

- It is impossible to provide different aliases for individual resource files. 
- Generated URIs have the form "alias/filename", which is fixed. For example, it is impossible to change the order of the alias and the file name or remove the slash character that separates them.

The new property ResourceSavingArgs.ResourceFileUri does not have the limitations of resource aliases and allows more control over URI construction. However, resource aliases are still useful in simple scenarios where resource saving callbacks introduce unnecessary overhead.h3. SaveOptions.DmlRenderingMode Introduced 

Within a separate fix a new option SaveOptions.DmlRenderingMode was introduced. It allows users to control how DrawingML shapes are rendered to fixed page formats. It has two possible values: 

### TOC Field Switch to Omit Page Numbers is Supported

The "\n" switch in TOC fields to omit page numbering during field generation is now supported. Any TOC field with this switch present will have page numbering removed. In previous versions this switch was ignored.h3. Trackmove Revisions Supported upon DOCX Round-trip 

In previous versions moving a portion of a document to another part of the document when tracked changed enabled would create a separate delete and insertion revision for the move. In this version the trackmove revision is now supported and the same edit will appear as a single move operation.
