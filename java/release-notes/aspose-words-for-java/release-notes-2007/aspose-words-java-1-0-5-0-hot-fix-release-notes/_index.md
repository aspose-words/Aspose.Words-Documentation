{{% /alert %}}

In this version:

- Updated Aspose.Words for Java API Reference. It is always up to date now since it is auto-generated from C# XML documentation with appropriate changes for Java.
  Ported the DocumentExplorer demo to Java, added as a demo project. 
  Added basic PDF export using iText to the demo projects. Note this export is very basic and is only intended to show how to extract content from a Word document using Aspose.Words. It is not suitable for production PDF export because a lot of formatting is not exported.
