This page contains release notes for [Aspose.Words for Java 2.3.0.0 Hot Fix](http://www.aspose.com/downloads/words/java/new-releases/aspose.words-for-java-2.3.0.0-hot-fix/)

This is a maintenance release that includes a Java version of fixes that were made in:

- Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.2
  Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.3 
  Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.4 
  Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.5 
  Aspose.Words for .NET 4.2.6 
  Aspose.Words for .NET 4.3.0 
  Aspose.Words for .NET 4.3.1 

The highlight of this release is:

· A great deal more of resiliency in the import of DOC files in Aspose.Words – reading of inconsistent/corrupted DOC files. 

· Added public API to create footnotes and control footnote properties. 

· Support of CSS shorthand attributes in HTML import. The very populat "font", "margins", "padding", "background", “border” attributes are now supported.

· The size of generated files is optimized - if the same image occurs multiple times in the document it is written to DOC and HTML files only once.
