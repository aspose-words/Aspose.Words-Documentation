## **About OpenDocument**
![todo:image_alt_text](opendocument-odt_1.png)

The [OpenDocument format (ODF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) is a free and open file format for electronic office documents originally developed by Sun for the Open Office suite. [OpenDocument Text (ODT)](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/odt/) is the file format for word processing documents. OpenDocument is currently an OASIS and ISO standard.
## **ODT in Aspose.Words**
Aspose.Words supports loading OpenDocument 1.1 and 1.2 documents. Aspose.Words saves documents in the OpenDocument 1.1 format. You can also see the [detailed specification](/words/java/document-interoperability/) about what OpenDocument features are supported.
