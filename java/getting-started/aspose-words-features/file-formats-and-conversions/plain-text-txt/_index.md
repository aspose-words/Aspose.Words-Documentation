## **TXT in Aspose.Words**

![todo:image_alt_text](plain-text-txt_1.png)

[TXT](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/txt/), or plain text, is a file format used to transfer information with very little formatting. Where [RTF ](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/rtf/)accommodates bold, underline and other styles, and [DOC](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/doc/) and [DOCX](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/) allows very sophisticated formatting, TXT contains nothing but ASCII characters. It is considered a universal format because any text editor can open a TXT file.

It is easy to extract plain text from any document using Aspose.Words. You can either save into a plain text file or programmatically get the text of any document element.

The top picture below shows the original document in Microsoft Word. The bottom picture shows Notepad with a document converted from RTF to TXT using Aspose.Words.
