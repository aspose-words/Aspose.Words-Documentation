A list used in a document is actually made up of many complex parts. List and their properties are fully supported by Aspose.Words.

There are two main types of lists:

- Numbered (Ordered)
- Bullet (Unordered)

Most properties of lists are supported by Aspose.Words. You can create new lists, access and modify properties of existing lists. You currently cannot remove an existing list from a document.

In all import formats the list value is not stored with the document, it is calculated dynamically. Aspose.Words automatically calculates the values for all list paragraphs in the document even for complex lists. You can retrieve this value through a property of the ListLabel class.

You can find what paragraphs a list is applied to and work with them manually. There are plans to allow to retrieve a list in the document body as an object. You can remove list formatting from a paragraph however you cannot remove a list reference from a document.

Lists are imported in HTML from &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; tags. Nested lists of different types are also supported during import. An &lt;li&gt; tag must be wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; tag to be imported as a proper list item, otherwise it is imported as a regular paragraph. We will look into importing such elements on there own as list items as well in a future version.

Lists can also appear in HTML as ordinary paragraphs, which appearance-wise are imported correctly, however are not read as proper List objects.

See the following links in the documentation for further information:

- **Paragraph.ListFormat**
- **Paragraph.ListLabel**
