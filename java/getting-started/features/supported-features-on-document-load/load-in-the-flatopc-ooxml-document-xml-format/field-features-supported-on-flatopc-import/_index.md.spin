Fields are place holders in the document which can be dynamically updated to display new information. The most common type of fields is MergeFields and Page fields. The first allows you to merge data into a document, the latter displays the current page number of the page where the field appears on.

Aspose.Words supports almost all common field types and can perform field update on most field types, even ones with complex content. This includes the TOC (Table of Contents) field. With one call to Document.UpdateFields the TOC field or any other supported field is fully updated. New or existing fields are fully updated by the Aspose.Words field engine. There is a document option to control the culture/locale used during field update. This can be the language setting of the field in the document or the current culture/locale used by the application.

A field is represented in the document model as:

- FieldStart node.
- Run node(s) (represents the field code).
- FieldSeparator node.
- Other nodes (represents the field result) such as runs, shapes. A field can span across many different types of content. A field result can consist of other block-level nodes such as Table or Paragraph.
- FieldEnd node.

We provide the Field facade for working with this structure more easily. This allows you to easily find the field code and field result of a field. Currently, you can only retrieve this facade while inserting a new field into the document, there are plans to introduce a new field API which allows you to get this facade from any field the document.

Using Aspose.Words you can insert new fields, as well as find and modify existing fields. You can also remove fields. You can also find the field code and field result of any field.

Currently to work with a field you need to iterate through the different field nodes above. Sometime soon we will release the Field API which will provide an API to achieve such operations much more easily.

Fields with custom field codes or field results (modified manually in the document to appear different) are retained during import and export. However, if you invoke field update, these might be replaced with the proper field content.

## Mail Merge

The mail merge engine allows you to quickly merge a variety of data into a document. You can merge simple data using simple mail merge as well as complex relational data from a database using merge regions. Both are easy to achieve using Aspose.Words.

Aspose.Words fully supports all of the mail merge features and fields with the exception of the following fields:

- Ask
- Database
- Fill-in
- SkipIf (consider using NextIf instead).

These fields will be supported in a later version of Aspose.Words. All other fields are supported.
