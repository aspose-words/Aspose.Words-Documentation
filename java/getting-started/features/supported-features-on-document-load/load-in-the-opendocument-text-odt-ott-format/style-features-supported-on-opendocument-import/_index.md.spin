{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

A style allows you to define a set of formatting that can be reused on many elements in a document. This saves time and allows for more consistent formatting throughout your document.

A style loaded into a document is represented in the Aspose.Words DOM by the Style class. You can access or modify any type of style (both in-built or custom) in a document.

You can also create a new style from scratch (with the exception of a table style which new styles cannot be created for currently). You can choose to set any style you want to document elements 

You currently cannot rename a style name or remove an existing style from a document. Copying styles from one document to another is also unsupported, however for the time being you can achieve this by copying a node with a style to another document. This will copy the source style along with it.
