The Aspose.Words rendering engine can render entire documents or certain pages of any document loaded into many different rendered formats.

These formats are:

- Raster image formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF. Each page of the document is exported as a separate frame in the output TIFF file.
- Vector image formats such as EMF and SVG.
- To any printing device.
- A Graphics object.

You can also render Shape nodes separatly from the document to image or a Graphics object.

Aspose.Words renders these documents with high fidelity and most document features are supported.

There are save options to control how the document is rendered. There are often a few special save options for each image format. For example there are options to:

- Specify the brightness, contrast and color mode for the rendered output.
- Specify the page or page range to render.
- Choose the paper background color.
- Choose the resolution, pixelformat or scale to render the document with.

Currently only TrueType font formats are used during rendering or printing. Support for OpenType fonts is currently in progress.

During printing you can specify the document name which appears in any print dialogs. All properties related to printing such as paper size, paper tray, orientation etc. for each page of the document are correctly sent to the printer.
