## Bookmarks

All Word documents and most other formats that Aspose.Words export to only allow bookmarks with unqiue names, that is, no two bookmarks are allowed the exact same name.

If two bookmarks are given the same name in the model then no errors will occur. During export to any format the duplicate bookmarks are removed silently. The first bookmark visited in the model is the one that is retained, any other bookmarks are removed,
