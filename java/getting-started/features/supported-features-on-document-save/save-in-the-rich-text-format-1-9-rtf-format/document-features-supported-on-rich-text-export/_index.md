## General

|**Feature**|**Supported**|**Comment**|**See Also**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Attached Template |Yes | | |
|Built-In Properties |Yes |Built-in properties such as word and character count are updated using Aspose.Words but are not updated automatically on save. <br><br>Instead you need to explictly update these properties using the appropriate Document member. We will add automatic update of these properties in a future version. |- **Document.UpdateWordCount**|

|Embedded Package |Yes |<p>Embedded packages are generally supported by Aspose.Words. There are two ways documents can be embedded inside other documents: </p><p>- OLE (this is available in DOC and OOXML formats) </p><p>- Package Embedding (available in OOXML only) <br><br>  Aspose.Words supports these in the following ways: <br><br>  If you have an OLE embedded or linked object it will be preserved during any conversion (e.g. DOC to DOCX or DOCX to DOC etc). <br><br>  If you have a Package Embedded document, then it will only be preserved during DOCX to DOCX conversion. <br><br>  There is no way to save a Package Embedded document from DOCX into a DOC file without converting it into an OLE embedded object. Implementing conversion of Package Embedded to OLE is tricky and it will take a while to implement. <br><br>  OLE objects contain "native data" and are supposed to be created by the actual OLE creating application. We at Aspose.Words have never attempted or planned to replace the behavior of OLE creating applications. <br><br>  Exported as a plain image. </p>| |
