## Floating Tables

Aspose.Words provides great support for the rendering of floating tables.

Currently floating shapes may not be properly positioned when an anchor is nested in a cell, belongs to a wrapped line or belongs to a paragraph with first/hanging indents, or to a second column on the page, and other advanced layouts. This may cause some content to overlap in the rendered output.

We are working to improve this with each release.
