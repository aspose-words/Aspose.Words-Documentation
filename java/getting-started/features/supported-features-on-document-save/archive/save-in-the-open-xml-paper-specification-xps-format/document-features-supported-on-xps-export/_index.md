XPS is a fixed-layout document format designed to preserve document fidelity and provide device-independent document appearance. Any document loaded into Aspose.Words can be converted to XPS.

Aspose.Words generates the XPS file (including subsetting TrueType fonts) completely on its own, without using any Windows or external libriares.

Aspose.Words also provides save options to control generation is handled. The following is some examples of such options:

- Export bookmarks or heading styles to the document outline (navigation pane).
- Specify the page range only to export.
- Set how metafiles are rendered.

Both TrueType and OpenFont font formats are supported and can be subsetted during rendering to XPS.
