Fields are supported in the model. To check if these fields can be updated check the import section.

Even if a field can be updated, most fields are exported if they are up-to-date by MS Word. i.e if you import a document and export it with a field as it is then it will appear properly in the output format.

Fields with custom field codes (a field code modified to represent something different than a normal field) are retained as they are when converting to other Word document formats. These fields are lost when exporting to ODT.

When saving to rendered formats such as PDF, XPS or image some fields may be automatically updated as a part of the page layout.

Fields that do not exist in ODT are converted to plain text when saved to ODT, others are exported as working fields.
