To Apply License using **Aspose.Words Java for Jython**. Here you can see example code.

from com.aspose.words import License

        dataDir = Settings.dataDir + 'quickstart/'

        # This line attempts to set a license from several locations relative to the executable and Aspose.Words.dll.
        # You can also use the additional overload to load a license from a stream, this is useful for instance when the
        # license is stored as an embedded resource
        try:
            license = License()
            license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.lic")
            print "License set successfully."
        except Exception as e:

            # We do not ship any license with this example, visit the Aspose site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license.
            print "There was an error setting the license." + e.getMessage()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ApplyLicense()
