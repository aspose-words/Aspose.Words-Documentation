To Load And Save To Stream using **Aspose.Words Java for Jython**. Here you can see example code.

**Jython Code**

{{< highlight ruby >}}
from aspose-words import Settings
from com.aspose.words import Document
from com.aspose.words import SaveFormat
from java.io import ByteArrayOutputStream
from java.io import FileInputStream
from java.io import FileOutputStream
class LoadAndSaveToStream:
    def __init__(self):
        dataDir = Settings.dataDir + 'quickstart/'

        # Open the stream. Read only access is enough for Aspose.Words to load a document.
        stream = FileInputStream(dataDir + 'Document.doc')

        # Load the entire document into memory.
        doc = Document(stream)

        # You can close the stream now, it is no longer needed because the document is in memory.
        stream.close()

        # ... do something with the document
        # Convert the document to a different format and save to stream.
        dstStream = ByteArrayOutputStream()
        doc.save(dstStream, SaveFormat.RTF)
        output = FileOutputStream(dataDir + "Document Out.rtf")
        output.write(dstStream.toByteArray())
        output.close()
        print "Document loaded from stream and then saved successfully."
if __name__ == '__main__':
