## Apache POI - HWPF and XWPF

**HWPF** is the name of Apache POI port of the Microsoft Word 97(-2007) file format to pure Java. It also provides limited read only support for the older Word 6 and Word 95 file formats. It is still in early development.

**XWPF** is partner to HWPF for the new Word 2007 .docx format is *XWPF*. Whilst HWPF and XWPF provide similar features, there is not a common interface across the two of them at this time. It has a fairly stable core API, providing read and write access to the main parts of a Word .docx file, but it isn't complete.

Both HWPF and XWPF provides Basis Text Extraction, Specific Text Extraction, Access of Header & Footers and Changing Text features.
