Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "AsposeComments.docx");
ArrayList collectedComments = new ArrayList();

// Collect all comments in the document
NodeCollection comments = doc.getChildNodes(NodeType.COMMENT, true);

// Look through all comments and gather information about them.
for (Comment comment : (Iterable<Comment>) comments)
{
    System.out.println(comment.getAuthor() + " - " + comment.getDateTime() + " - "
	    + comment.toString(SaveFormat.TEXT));
