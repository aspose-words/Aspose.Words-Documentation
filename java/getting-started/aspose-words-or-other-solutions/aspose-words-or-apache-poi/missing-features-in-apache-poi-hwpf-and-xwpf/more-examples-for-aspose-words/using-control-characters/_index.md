## Aspose.Words - Using Control Characters

The **ControlChar** class is a repository for the constants that represent control characters often encountered in documents. It provides both char and string versions of the same constants. For example, string **ControlChar.LineBreak** and char **ControlChar.LineBreakChar** have the same value.

**Java**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
text.replace(ControlChar.CR, ControlChar.CR_LF);
{{< /highlight >}}
