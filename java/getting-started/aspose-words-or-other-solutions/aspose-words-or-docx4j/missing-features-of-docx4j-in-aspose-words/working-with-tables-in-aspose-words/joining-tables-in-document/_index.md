## Aspose.Words - Joining Tables in Document

A table which is represented in the Aspose.Words Document Object Model is made up of independent rows and cells which makes joining or splitting tables easy.

In order to manipulate a table to split or join with another table we simply need to move the rows from one table to another.

**Java**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "tableDoc.doc");

// Get the first and second table in the document.

// The rows from the second table will be appended to the end of the first table.
Table firstTable = (Table)doc.getChild(NodeType.TABLE, 0, true);
Table secondTable = (Table)doc.getChild(NodeType.TABLE, 1, true);

// Append all rows from the current table to the next.

// Due to the design of tables even tables with different cell count and widths can be joined into one table.
while (secondTable.hasChildNodes())
    firstTable.getRows().add(secondTable.getFirstRow());

// Remove the empty table container.
secondTable.remove();
