As already described in previous articles, there are operations with documents that are faster and more conveniently to perform using Aspose.Words than docx4j. But there are also operations that are not provided by docx4j. You can try to achieve the desired result using auxiliary tools and options, but even if successful, it will be quite expensive.

The following table contains some of the popular features supported by Aspose.Words and missed in docx4j:

| Aspose.Words feature                                         | Corresponding documentation article or section               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Convert between different document formats. For example, Word to PDF, HTML to Markdown, DOCX to JPG, PDF to Word, Image to PDF, and others | The [“Convert a Document”](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/convert-a-document/) section |
| Mail Merge                                                   | The [”Mail Merge and Reporting”](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/mail-merge-and-reporting/) section |
| Rendering                                                    | The [”Rendering”](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/rendering/) section |
| Join {multiple|several|a few|many|numerous} documents, including combine formatting of documents when importing content | The [“Insert and Append Documents”](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/insert-and-append-documents/) article |
| Find and Replace                                             | The [“Find and Replace”](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/find-and-replace/) article |
| Manipulate tables                                            | The [“Working with Tables”](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/working-with-tables/) section |
| Manipulate form fields                                       | The [“Working with Form Fields”](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/working-with-form-fields/) article |

The table is not complete, so you can check [our documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/) for the feature you are interested in.

In the child articles, we also provide {a few|multiple|several|many|numerous} examples of how various popular features can be implemented using Aspose.Words.
