Sometimes we get the following question: why should we use Aspose products rather than the docx4j? This question is easy to answer: features and functionality.

Docx4j is an open source (ASLv2) Java library for creating and manipulating documents in Microsoft Open XML Word formats. It is similar to Microsoft Open XML SDK for Java. Docx4j uses JAXB to create an in-memory object representation, and it will take you a while to understand JAXB and the Open XML file structure.

Aspose.Words is a very useful document processing library that provides great support for all Microsoft Word and other document formats. With Aspose.Words you can view, generate, modify, convert, render, and print documents without using Microsoft Word.

In this article, we will look at when it makes sense for you to prefer Aspose.Words.

## Why not docx4j

It is worth noting that some tasks can be achieved with Aspose.Words, but cannot be accomplished with docx4j.

You can compare docx4j with Aspose. To do this, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the [Aspose.Words Java for Docx4j](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-Java/releases/tag/Aspose.Words_Java_for_Docx4j-v1.0.0) – it demonstrates how different tasks can be done using the Aspose.Words for Java API versus docx4j. The project also covers features for working with text documents that are only available in Aspose.Words, but not in docx4j.

This project is also useful for developers looking to migrate from docx4j to Aspose.Words.

In the following sections and articles, we will take a closer look at some of the features and abilities provided by Aspose.Words.

### Stability

Aspose components are thoroughly tested. Since Aspose components are packaged into a single DLL, there will never be a need to install any additional parts or pieces for them to function. This enables not only to provide a stable work with Aspose.Words, but also reduce the risk of unforeseen situations to virtually zero.

### Scalability and Speed

Aspose components are highly scalable and lightning fast. They are a true Java solution and perform flawlessly on either a single server powering a single application or a load balanced web farm powering an enterprise application.

### Features

Aspose components provide everything you need to manage Office files, plus much, much more. They are designed with the philosophy of allowing developers to accomplish the greatest results with the least amount of work.

Aspose components provide many powerful time-saving functions. For example, [Aspose.Words](https://products.aspose.com/words/java/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3-HX4PDI8gIVDKxoCh2CKwMnEAEYASAAEgJTm_D_BwE) offers a feature that allows developers to populate a Word mail merge document from [any data source supported by Aspose.Words for Java](https://docs.aspose.com/words/java/mail-merge-and-reporting/#data-source-types-for-a-mail-merge-operation). It is worth noting that every component in the Aspose family offers its own set of unique and powerful features.
