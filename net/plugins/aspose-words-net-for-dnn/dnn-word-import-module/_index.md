## **Introduction**

Aspose .NET Word Import for DNN Module allows developers to get/read contents of Word document without requiring any other software such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice. This module demonstrates the powerful import feature provided by [Aspose.Word](http://www.aspose.com/word-component-suite.aspx). It adds a simple file browser control, Content Pane selection and **Import from Word** button on the page where the module is added. When clicking on the button, the document contents are displayed on the screen immediately.

## **Support, Extend and Contribute**

### **Support**

From the very first days of Aspose, we knew that just giving our customers good products would not be enough. We also needed to deliver good service. We are developers ourselves and understand how frustrating it is when a technical issue or a quirk in the software stops you from doing what you need to do. We're here to solve problems, not create them.

This is why we offer free support. Anyone who uses our product, whether they have bought them or are using an evaluation, deserves our full attention and respect.
