## **What is OpenXML?**

OpenXML SDK is a .NET SDK from Microsoft in order to process Microsoft Office 2007 and above file formats. These file formats are basically zipped packages and the Open XML SDK for Office simplifies the task of manipulating Open XML packages and the underlying Open XML schema elements within a package. The classes in the Open XML SDK encapsulate many common tasks that developers perform on Open XML packages, so that you can perform complex operations with lines of code.

Once you have installed the Open XML SDK 2.5, open your existing project or application in Visual Studio, or create a new project or application. Then, in your project or application, add references to the following components:

- DocumentFormat.OpenXml
- WindowsBase

## **Aspose.Words for .Net**

Using these APIs, the .NET developers can perform simple and complex operations over various word processing formats including MS Word and OpenOffice documents. The APIs also provide conversion and rendering features for these file formats.

### **Introduction**

The developers looking for file format libraries may need to walk through the features provided by the libraries available on the market. Mainly, two factors are considered when choosing an option:

- Features
- Efforts required to use the library

If you are a .NET developer looking for faster,easy and light-weight file format library to process files, you may need to compare VSTO(Visual Studio tool for Office) with Aspose. In this case, this project will help you to compare features and code in both libraries.
