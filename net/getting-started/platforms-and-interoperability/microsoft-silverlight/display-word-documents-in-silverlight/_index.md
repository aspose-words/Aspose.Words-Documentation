*Document Toolkit* is a product of First Floor Software and provides a fast and feature-rich XPS document viewer library for Silverlight. The XML Paper Specification (XPS) is a fixed document format similar to PDF. In order to render Word documents in Silverlight, *Document Toolkit* requires the document to be converted to the XPS format first. 

*Aspose.Words for .NET* is a document processing library by Aspose and provides document conversion to the XPS format. *Aspose.Words* supports all modern Word documents formats available today including Word 97-2003, Word 2007, WordML and OOXML. Conversion of OpenDocument (ODT), Rich Text Format (RTF) and HTML documents is supported as well.

### How it Works

Aspose.Words is a .NET class library that runs on the server. Document Toolkit is a 100% client only XPS document viewer and runs in a Silverlight AppDomain on the client. An ASP.NET document service on the server uses Aspose.Words to convert documents on-the-fly to XPS the moment Document Toolkit requests (a part of) a document.
