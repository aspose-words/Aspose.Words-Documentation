*Document Toolkit* is a product of First Floor Software and provides a fast and feature-rich XPS document viewer library for Silverlight. The XML Paper Specification (XPS) is a fixed document format similar to PDF. In order to render Word documents in Silverlight, *Document Toolkit* requires the document to be converted to the XPS format first. 

*Aspose.Words for .NET* is a document processing library by Aspose and provides document conversion to the XPS format. *Aspose.Words* supports all modern Word documents formats available today including Word 97-2003, Word 2007, WordML and OOXML. Conversion of OpenDocument (ODT), Rich Text Format (RTF) and HTML documents is supported as well.

#### **Online Demo**

Aspose.Words for .NET and Document Toolkit for Silverlight together provide an easy, powerful and seamless document viewing experience in Silverlight as is demonstrated in the online demo application. Run the application and view your own Word, Open Office, RTF and HTML documents right in Silverlight.

[Launch the demo application](http://www.aspose.com/demos/.net-components/aspose.words/csharp/silverlight/demo.aspx) (requires [Silverlight 3](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) ). 

#### **How it Works**

Aspose.Words is a .NET class library that runs on the server. Document Toolkit is a 100% client only XPS document viewer and runs in a Silverlight AppDomain on the client. An ASP.NET document service on the server uses Aspose.Words to convert documents on-the-fly to XPS the moment Document Toolkit requests (a part of) a document.
