## Getting Started

### Content Exporter Module

Aspose .NET Word Processing and PDF Document Exporter for Kentico allow users to export online content into Word Processing or PDF document using [Aspose.Words](http://www.aspose.com/word-component-suite.aspx). It adds **Export to Word** and **Export to Pdf** buttons at any desired location on the page. Clicking a button dynamically exports the content of the page to a Word Processing or PDF document and then automatically downloads the file to the disk location selected by the user in just couple of seconds.

This initial version of the web part provides a number of great features, including:

- Get an offline copy of your favorite online content for editing, sharing and printing in the popular DOC or PDF formats.
- Ability to customize/localize button text while adding web part to the page.
- The generated Word processing document can then be opened using any Word Processing Application such as Microsoft Word or Apache OpenOffice etc.
- The generated PDF document can be opened using any PDF viewer or reader.
