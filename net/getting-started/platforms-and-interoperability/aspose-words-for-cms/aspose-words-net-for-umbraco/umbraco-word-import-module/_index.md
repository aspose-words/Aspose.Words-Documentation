Umbraco Word Import is an open source module from [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/) that allow developers to get/read contents of any Word processing document without requiring any other software such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice. This module demonstrates the powerful import feature provided by [Aspose.Word](http://www.aspose.com/word-component-suite.aspx). It adds a simple file browser control and **Import from Word** button on the page where the add-on is added. When clicking on the button, the document contents are fetched from the file and displayed on the screen immediately.
