### **No Microsoft Word Automation**
Aspose.Words does not require Microsoft Office to be installed on the machine in order to work. All Aspose components are totally independent and are not affiliated with, nor authorized, sponsored, or otherwise approved by Microsoft Corporation. In short, Aspose.Words is a better alternative to automation in terms of security, stability, scalability/speed, price and features.
### **Platform Independence**
Aspose.Words for .NET and Aspose.Words for Java are “twin brothers” products and together cover most of the popular development environments and deployment platforms.

Both Aspose.Words for .NET and Aspose.Words for Java run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS operating systems.

You can use Aspose.Words for .NET to build any type of a 32-bit or 64-bit .NET application including ASP.NET, WCF, WinForms etc. It is possible to use Aspose.Words for .NET via COM Interop from ASP, Perl, PHP and Python. You can also use Aspose.Words for .NET to build applications with Mono.

Aspose.Words for Java is available for Java 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 and will run in any place where Java is installed. It is possible to use Aspose.Words for Java from Perl, PHP and Python.
### **Performance and Scalability**
Aspose.Words is designed to perform great both on a server or client. Aspose.Words is a single .NET assembly that can be deployed with any .NET application by simply copying it. You do not have to worry about any other services or modules. You can literally generate thousands of documents in minutes with Aspose.Words and that involves opening a document, modifying content and formatting or populating it with data and saving it. Even most of the complex documents are opened and saved on a P4 2.4Ghz 1Gb RAM machine in fractions of a second.

Aspose.Words is multithread safe as long as only one thread works on a document at a time. It is a typical scenario to have one thread working on one document. Different threads can safely work on different documents at the same time.
### **Minimal Learning Curve**
Although there are over 150 public classes and enumerations in Aspose.Words, the learning curve is minimal because of the Aspose.Words API has been carefully designed with the following goals in mind:

- Borrow best practices from other well-known APIs such as Microsoft Word Automation
- Borrow best practices from the .NET Framework Design Guidelines
- Provide a balance of easy usage vs detailed document element manipulation

Developers, who used Microsoft Word Automation in their projects before, will find names and behavior of many classes, methods and properties familiar.

If you worked with any XML DOM library you will find it is easy to understand and work with Aspose.Words.
