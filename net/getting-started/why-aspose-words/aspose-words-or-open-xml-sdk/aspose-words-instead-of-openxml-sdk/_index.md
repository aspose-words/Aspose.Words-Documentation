When a user needs to create, modify, and manage documents programmatically, it is always important to choose the right tool that fits the particular document development needs. This article aims to help developers make the right decision by comparing Aspose.Words and Open XML SDK.

It is worth noting once again that Aspose.Words and the Open XML SDK can do similar things, but Aspose.Words' functionality is much broader and is not limited to creating only OOXML documents.

You can learn more about the requirements and further steps on this page.

## Get Started with Aspose.Words

After learning the ["Installation"](/words/net/installation/) page and completing the required steps, you are ready to start working with Aspose.Words.

Explore the ["Getting Started"](/words/net/getting-started/) section to familiarize yourself with the basic requirements and capabilities and the ["Developer Guide"](/words/net/developer-guide/) section to learn about various practical use cases – how to achieve a certain document appearance, how to apply a particular function, and so on.

Some simple use cases can be implemented using the free Open XML SDK, but much more complex use cases are easier and faster to implement using Aspose.Words. There are several use cases where Open XML SDK implementation is complex or requires strong file format knowledge.

Aspose.Words also provides source code examples for features missing in Open XML SDK. You can find:

* A list of such features on the ["Missing Features of Open XML SDK Words"](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-.NET/releases/tag/MissingFeaturesofOpenXMLWordsv1.1) page
