Aspose.Words provides a wide range of features to work with documents in various formats. It is important to note that there is no limit on the maximum size of a document file that Aspose.Words can process or render. The only limitation is the amount of RAM (memory) available on your side.

## How much memory Aspose.Words needs?

Usually Aspose.Words needs **a few times more memory than document size to build a model of the document in memory. For example, if your document’s size is 1 MB**, Aspose.Words needs 10-20 MB of RAM to build its Document Object Model (DOM) in memory. The multiplier depends on the format because some formats are more compact than others. For example, DOCX is more compact than DOC and RTF, and DOC is more compact than RTF.

In any case, there is no exact way to estimate how much memory Aspose.Words actually consumes during processing any particular document file. As you may know .Net stores data in classes, each class instance uses some memory for internal CLR purposes. So, any paragraph or formatted text (even it consists of one character) takes some extra memory after loading into DOM. Moreover, the .Net garbage collector's engine uses a complex algorithm to determine the best time to perform a memory collection, that makes it difficult to determine the real memory consumption.
For example, let’s consider two documents: DOCX document «A» 0.35 MB size (2 thousand pages), with text only and DOCX document «B» 0.35 MB size (just 1 page), with PNG image inside.

As you know, a lot of modern formats like DOCX, ODT etc. are simple ZIP archives. So, the first step is unzipping. Unzipped document «A» has 20 MB size, the document «B» has 0.4 MB size.
The next step is loading document to the model (build its Document Object Model).
Creating DOM of the first document «A» requires 49 MB size.
Creating DOM of the second document «B» requires just 2 MB size.
Let’s measure the required memory size to render these documents to PDF.
For this operation, Aspose.Words requires 294 MB for the document «A» and just 7 MB for the document «B».

So, as you can see, there is no linear dependence from the input document size. There are a lot of factors which may affect the required RAM size – document format, it's complexity and structure, image count and their format and a lot of other factors.
The experiments with thousands of real documents shows that Aspose.Words requires few times more memory than average document size to build a model of the document in memory and to perform simple operations like conversion between flow formats, mail merge, parse, replace etc. More complicated operations like rendering (converting to fixed page formats), update fields, page splitting etc. sometimes require 20 times more memory than memory allocated by the document loaded in Aspose.Words DOM.
