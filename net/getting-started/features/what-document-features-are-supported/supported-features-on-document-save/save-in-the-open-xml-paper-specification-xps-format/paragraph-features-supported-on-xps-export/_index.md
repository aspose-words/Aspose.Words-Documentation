##### **Text Frames**
Floating content is generally supported well during rendering.

Currently floating shapes may not be properly positioned when anchor is nested in a cell, belongs to a wrapped line or belongs to a paragraph with first/hanging indents, or to a 2nd column on the page, and other advanced layouts. This may cause some content to overlap in the rendered output.

We are working to improve this with each release.
