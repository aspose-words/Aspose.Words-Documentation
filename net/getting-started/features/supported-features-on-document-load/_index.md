Aspose.Words allows users to work with documents in various formats and provides a wide range of options for this. For example, users can create a document from scratch or load an existing file in any [supported import format](/words/net/supported-document-formats/), make some changes to that document and then save the result. When importing a document in the selected format, the user can apply various load options.

It is important to know that many load options are common to all supported formats, and only some of the options are format-specific, such as PDF, HTML, RTF, and others.
