Aspose.Words supports many types of drawing entities on document load.

Graphic objects in any document format loaded into Aspose.Words are represented in the model by Shape nodes. This node type provides member which allow you to access and modify both the image data and also the properties of the object such as positioning and behavior.

Using Aspose.Words you can create and modify different types of graphic objects.

Almost all properties that deal with object positioning use points as a unit of measurment. There is a class to help work with points by converting different types of units to and from points e.g pixel to point, point to inch.

## Images

You can insert new images of any type into a document by using the DocumentBuilder.InsertImage method or by setting the image of an existing shape using the Shape.ImageData property.

All of the following image types listed in the table below this overview are supported. When a document contains multiple references to the same image from an from an external address (e.g the internet) then the image is only downloaded once.

It is useful to know how images are stored in the model when you insert a new image using Aspose.Words There are three classes of image from the Aspose.Words point-of-view.

1. Microsoft Word Native (which can be stored directly in model without any changes). These are the JPEG, PNG, and PICT formats and are left untouched during insertion.

2. Windows Metafiles (can also be stored directly in the model). These are the EMF and WMF vector formats and are left untouched during insertion.

3. Microsoft Word Non-Native. These are not supported and have to be converted (to PNG) before being stored in the model. These are the GIF, TIFF and BMP formats.

Aspose.Words automatically converts the formats found in the third item if such a format is inserted into a document.

The reason why the formats found in the third item must be converted to PNG is because Microsoft Word formats don't support the GIF or TIFF formats. It makes sense to store these in memory in a format that is supported by Microsoft Word. Note that when you insert an image of these types in Microsoft Word it also converts them to PNG in the same way behind the scenes.

BMP is the exception and is supported by Microsoft Word. However, since a BMP stored in memory is often very large it too is converted to PNG to save memory.

Note that PNG is a lossless compression format, so there is no degregration of image quality using the above techniques.

If you are using Aspose.Words for Java you may need to ensure that you have the appropriate JAI image libraries installed in order for Aspose.Words to convert GIF, TIFF and BMP formats to PNG. If the required functionality is missing you may recieve a "Image type not supported" exception.

## OLE Objects

OLE Objects represent embedded content in a Microsoft Word document, such as an embedded Excel or Powerpoint document. The OLE object is dynamic and can be edited or updated through Microsoft Word. This feature is fully supported and preserved during document conversion.

OLE data can be accessed and modified through properties of the Shape class. You can extract and save OLE data to stream or disk.

Currently embedding new or updating existing OLE Objects is not supported in Aspose.Words.

See the following links in the documentation for further information:

- **Shape.OleFormat**

|Linked |Yes |Note that Aspose.Words cannot update an OLE link. However you can modify a link only OLE object to point to a new location which can provide a partial way of changing OLE objects. <br><br>When such a document is saved and opened in Microsoft Word it will detect the change in link and prompt the user to update the linked object. This results in the linked object appearing in the document. <br><br>Such a tecnhique will only work for Word formats and if the document is opened in an editor which allows to update OLE objects (such as Microsoft Word). If the link is changed and the document to a different format such as PDF then the original content will still appear in the output. |<p>- [OleFormat.IsLink](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/OleFormat/properties/islink) </p><p>- [OleFormat.SourceFullName](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/OleFormat/properties/sourcefullname)</p>|

## ActiveX Controls

ActiveX Controls are preserved and supported during import. ActiveX is normally imported as a Shape node. Some ActiveX may also have an assosicated field.

You currently cannot create or modify existing ActiveX controls in a

document. You can however retrieve certain parts of data from controls (mostly parts assosicated with the graphic of the control).

|Persistent Properties Storage |Yes | | |

## Shapes

Aspose.Words supports almost all Shape and Image elements. References to external images such as ones on the internet are automatically downloaded as well. All of these elements are imported into Aspose.Words as Shape nodes.

Using Aspose.Words you can create any type of new shape including images, AutoShapes etc. you can also access, modify and remove such elements from a document.

Most common properties such as borders or position can be modified through the API. There is currently no API for modifying advanced shape properties e.g ArcSize of a RoundRectangle.

There is also no API for creating or modifiying advanced features such as Diagrams, Ink Annotations or Charts. These elements are retained fully during conversion.

Shapes which are linked to external resources such as images on the internet can be automatically downloaded when required.

## WordArt

WordArt is imported as a Shape object in Aspose.Words. This class provides properties to extract and modify properties of a WordArt object.

Using Aspose.Words you can create new WordArt graphics. Note that not all WordArt features are avalible through the API.

See the following links in the documentation for further information:

## Horizontal Line Object

Horizontal Line Objects are represented as a Shape node in Aspose.Words. Since a Shape can also represent an image there is a property which returns if this shape is a Horizontal Line Object.

Using Aspose.Words you can create new or modify existing Horizontal Rule objects.
