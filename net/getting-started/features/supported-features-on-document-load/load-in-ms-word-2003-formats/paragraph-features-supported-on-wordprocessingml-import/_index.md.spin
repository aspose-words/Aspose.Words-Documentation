Each paragraph in a document is represented in Aspose.Words as a Paragraph node. A paragraph represesents a block of text in a document and have a variety of properties and styles.

Using Aspose.Words you can access and change virtually all properties of a paragraph. Nearly all paragraph attributes are supported. You can also easily insert and remove paragraphs.

Paragraph formatting is contained within the ParagraphFormat class which is linked to the paragraph.

## Tab Stops

All features of tab stops are supported in Aspose.Words except for relative tab stops.

Using Aspose.Words you can find tab stops based off position or index. You can change tab stop features like position, alignment etc or remove tabstops completely.

See the following link in the documentation for further information:

- [ParagraphFormat.TabStops](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/ParagraphFormat/properties/tabstops)

|**Feature**|**Supported**|**Comment**|**See Also**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Absolute Position |Yes | |- [TabStop.Position](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/TabStop/properties/position)|
|Relative Position |Yes |A relative position tab can be inserted in Microsoft Word using the "Insert Alignment Tab" button. This type of tab is relative to either the page margin or the indent of the paragraph. <br><br>This allows tab stops to appear in the same relative place even when the position of the paragraph or page is modified. <br><br>Currently Aspose.Words supports these types of tab stops in OOXML and WordML formats only. There is currently no API to retrieve the properties of this tab e.g RelativeTo, Alignment, Leader etc. Further support is planned. |- [AbsolutePositionTab](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/AbsolutePositionTab)|
|Alignment: Left, Center, Right, Decimal, Bar |Yes | |- [TabStop.Alignment](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/TabStop/properties/alignment)|
|Leader |Yes | |- [TabStop.Leader](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/TabStop/properties/leader)|

## Drop Caps

Drop Caps are partially supported and preserved during document conversion. A drop cap is a text frame which is imported as a separate paragraph (from the rest of the paragraph as seen in the source document).

You can modify drop cap properties and position, however the new settings are not applied to the drop cap. You cannot yet create new drop caps (although you can easily simulate them through the use of a textbox). 

This will be improved in a future version of Aspose.Words.
