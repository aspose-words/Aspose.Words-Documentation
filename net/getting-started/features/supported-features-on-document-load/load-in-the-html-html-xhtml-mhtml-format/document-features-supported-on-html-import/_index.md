Aspose.Words supports importing and exporting HTML based documents. You can load such documents in the Document Object Model, edit and add new content and convert them to any supported format such as DOCX, PDF, Image etc.

The Aspose.Words HTML engine is resilient and can properly import simple and complex HTML even if there are problems with it, resolving any malformed structure, parts and ignoring any unsupported tags. Most common native HTML tags and CSS formatting are supported during import. The input HTML can skip tags and still be imported well e.g you can miss out &lt;p&gt; or &lt;span&gt; tags and the text content is still imported properly.

Note that Aspose.Words works with Word documents, therefore not all HTML features are supported during import and export. Not all HTML attributes may be imported as they do not have Microsoft Word equivalents. Also during export some document features may not be included as they cannot be represented in HTML properly. There may be many "N/A" values in this list for these reasons however Aspose.Words strives to support all HTML features possible.

Normally elements or attributes that do not have an eqivilant feature in a Microsoft Word document are ignored during import.

You can set the BaseUri path of the document being loaded so relative resources can be correctly imported.

Aspose.Words supports most CSS 1 and CCS 2 properties that have an eqivilant use in Word documents. Note that multiple classes on a single class attribute is currently not supported during import.

The HTML produced by Aspose.Words conforms to HTML 4.0 or XHTML 1.0 Transitional specifications. Multiparts/mixed content is supported in HTML during load. You can choose the encoding used during import from and export to HTML based formats. During load you can choose to auto detect the encoding.

Aspose.Words does not deal with Javascript and no Javascript is read or written during open and save. If you are dealing with a page which part of is generated dynamically using Javascript then you still achieve the same results by first emulating the page in a browser and then importing the page source. This can be automated. Adding Javascript to an output HTML document can be done with some simple postprocessing.

Currently special Microsoft "mso" attributes are not imported or exported with the exception of "mso-break-type"which is supported both in import and export. These properties help with round-tripping HTML back to a document format but significantly bloat the HTML which is why most users want to avoid such extra markup. However since it is a useful tool to provide Word-HTML round-trip, we will support these attributes both import and export in a future version.
