An endnote or footnote is a note that appears at the bottom of a page that is commonly used by writers to cite other authors publication in their document.

Using Aspose.Words you can interact with footnotes and endnotes and access or modify footnote related propeties such as the location of the footnotes and when they restart.

Footnotes and endnote markers are imported as hyperlinks. The content of these is separated at the bottom of the section with a horizontal rule.

There is a sample project which demonstrates how to convert this type of footnote import into proper footnotes again.
