A table is comprised of rows and cells and is used to display data in a grid-like layout.

Aspose.Words supports imports of tables from all loaded formats including Microsoft Word, Open Office and HTML documents.

A table is represented in Aspose.Words by a Table node. Each row of the table is represented by a separate Row node. Likewise each cell of the row is represented by a Cell node. Each node type has it's own formatting properties which controls the table's apperance and behavior.

- Table contains the properties for controlling the formatting of a table as a whole.
- Each Row provides a RowFormat object which contains the properties that control formatting for that particular row.
- Each Cell has a CellFormat object which provides properties to control the formatting of each cell.

Using Aspose.Words you can access and modify all features and formatting of a table along with creating new tables and removing existing ones from the document.

Note that some elements of a table may be wrapped with Markup nodes such as CustomXmlMarkup or StructuredDocumentTag nodes.

A table is imported from source HTML from &lt;table&gt; and other applicable tags.

Currently CSS styles are not imported from table, tr and td elements on import. These feature are planned. You can define inline styles on TD in the mean time.

Floating tables are supported during import and export. However there is currently no API to access or modify the floating position of a table.

Floating tables are imported as inline.

## Table Borders

Table borders are stored in the rows of the table. This mimics the structure of an OOXML document.

If you try to set borders or shading on a table without any rows then an exception will be thrown. Add at least one row first.

Borders are imported from each cell from style attribute border-XXX-style, border-XXX-color etc.

See the following links in the documentation for further information:
