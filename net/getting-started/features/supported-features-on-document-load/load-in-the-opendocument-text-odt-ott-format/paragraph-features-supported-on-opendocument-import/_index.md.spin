## Text Frames

This is the legacy text frames from Word 97, not to be confused with the Autoshape Textbox which is discussed under Drawing Objects.

Text frames are preserved in the model but there is no API or node to modify or access information about frames.

Text from text frames is saved to ODT as normal text paragraphs.

During round trip these will be imported back as normal paragraps and not text frames.

## Tab Stops

All features of tab stops are supported in Aspose.Words except for relative tab stops.

Using Aspose.Words you can find tab stops based off position or index. You can change tab stop features like position, alignment etc or remove tabstops completely.

See the following link in the documentation for further information:

- [ParagraphFormat.TabStops](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/paragraphformat/properties/tabstops)

|**Feature**|**Supported**|**Comment**|**See Also**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |

|Relative Position |N/A | | |
|Alignment: Left, Center, Right, Decimal, Bar |Yes | |- [TabStop.Alignment](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/tabstop/properties/alignment)|
|Leader |Yes | |- [TabStop.Leader](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/tabstop/properties/leader)|

## Drop Caps

Drop Caps are partially supported and preserved during document conversion. A drop cap is a text frame which is imported as a separate paragraph (from the rest of the paragraph as seen in the source document).

You can modify drop cap properties and position, however the new settings are not applied to the drop cap. You cannot yet create new drop caps (although you can easily simulate them through the use of a textbox). 

This will be improved in a future version of Aspose.Words.
