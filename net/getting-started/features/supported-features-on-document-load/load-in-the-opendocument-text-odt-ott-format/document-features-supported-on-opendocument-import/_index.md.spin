Aspose.Words has impressive support in import and export of OpenDocument 1.1 and 1.2 documents. You can convert any loaded document (such as DOC, DOCX, or HTML) to ODT or start with a ODT document and convert it to any other supported format.

Most features in an OpenDocument have equivalents in Word Documents so conversion between these two formats is normally done with high fidelity. 

Aspose.Words always saves documents in the OpenDocument 1.1 format.

| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Attached Template |N/A | | |
|Built-In Properties |Yes |All Built-in Document Properties can be accessed and modified in Aspose.Words API. <br><br>There are methods to update the "count" properties such as character, word and page count. All such properties are supported with the exception of the "line" count which is currently not updated. <br><br>All properties are read from ODT, however some Microsoft Word document properties do not have corresponding properties in ODT so will not be present after load. |<p>- [Document.BuiltInDocumentProperties](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document/properties/builtindocumentproperties) </p><p>- [Document.UpdatePageLayout](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document/properties/updatepagelayout) </p><p>- [Document.UpdateWordCount](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document/properties/updatewordcount)</p>|

|Custom XML Data Storage |N/A | | |
|Digital Signature |Yes |A digital signature ensures that the content of a document has not been tampered with during transit. A signature is applied over the document so if any part of it is modified the signature is invalidated. <br><br>When you load a document into Aspose.Words the document signature is automatically lost. This is by design as the document is not the same anymore. You will need to reapply another signature during export, however currently Aspose.Words only signs PDF documents on output. <br><br>There are plans to support signing documents on export when saving in the OOXML, DOC, ODT or XPS format. <br><br>Detection, access and verification of digital signatures is supported. <br><br>Signing is not yet supported. |<p>- [Working with Digital Signatures](/words/net/working-with-digital-signatures/) </p><p>- **Document.DigitalSigntures** </p><p>- [DigitalSignatureCollection.IsValid](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/DigitalSignatureCollection/properties/isvalid)</p>|

|Encryption |Planned |Encrypted documents can be loaded into Aspose.Words as long as the password supplied on load for the document is correct. <br><br>XOR obfuscation is currently unsupported. <br><br>Encrypting a document during save is currently unsupported with the exception when saving in DOC format. <br><br>Encrypted ODT documents may encounter an exception during load. |<p>- [LoadOptions.Password](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/loadoptions/properties/password) </p><p>- [FileFormatInfo.IsEncrypted](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/FileFormatInfo/properties/isencrypted)</p>|
