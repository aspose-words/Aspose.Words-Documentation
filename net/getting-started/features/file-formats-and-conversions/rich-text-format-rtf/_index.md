## **About RTF**

|![todo:image_alt_text](rich-text-format-rtf_1.png)|The [Rich Text Format (RTF)](https://wiki.fileformat.com/word-processing/rtf/) is one of the document formats supported by Microsoft Word and many other word processing applications. RTF is a human-readable word processing format intended for interchange between different applications on various platforms and it has been around for 20 years. <br>The new XML-based formats are becoming more common, but RTF is still being supported and updated by Microsoft. The latest version is RTF 1.9 Specification dated January 2007.|

## **RTF in Aspose.Words**
Aspose.Words can read and write files in the RTF format of any version. The RTF specification is a set of keywords. There are over 1400 keywords in the RTF 1.9 Specification and Aspose.Words API fully supports (reads and writes) most of these keywords. It is hard to find a similar level of implementation in other products. Unknown keywords (unsupported or from newer specifications) are safely ignored.
