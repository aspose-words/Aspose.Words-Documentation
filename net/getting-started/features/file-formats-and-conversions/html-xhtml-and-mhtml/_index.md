HTML conversion in Aspose.Words is customizable. Many parameters like export of document properties, headers and footers, images location, scaling and resolution, form field export options and others can be specified. Aspose.Words HTML import is resilient to documents that are not well-formed or are invalid. Invalid or unrecognized elements or attributes are safely ignored during import. You can also see the [detailed specification](/words/net/document-interoperability-html/) about what HTML features are supported by Aspose.Words.
