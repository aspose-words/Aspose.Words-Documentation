Table is exported to HTML as &lt;table&gt; and other applicable tags.

There is a save option to control how table and cell widths are exported. You can choose to export absolute and relative values, relative values only or no width. When no width is exported then the viewer must calculate the appropriate widths for the table elements.

See the following link in the documentation for further information:

- [HtmlSaveOptions.TableWidthOutputMode](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/properties/tablewidthoutputmode)
