{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Most drawing objects are exported using the img element unless there is native support for the feature. HTML does not have support for a lot of Word graphics options therefore these features are rendered to image before export. There are options to choose a folder or streams to save images to during export to HTML. There is also an option to export image data embedded in the HTML as base64. You can export the document as MHTML to automatically embed all image data.

You can control the name of the generated image file by using the ImageSavingCallback in the HtmlSaveOptions class.

Currently images are only exported as absolute size (points) and not in percent. This means that images will not resize when the "Increase Text/Decrease Text" buttons are pressed. These buttons are common in browsers and eReaders.

This feature will be supported in the future.

## Images

All images are exported as the same format that they were originally loaded as.

| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|PNG |Yes | | |
|JPG |Yes | | |

|EMF |Yes | | |
|EMF+ |Yes | | |
|BMP |Yes | | |
|GIF |Yes | | |
|TIFF |Yes | | |

## Image Recoloring

|Brightness |Yes | | |
|Contrast |Yes | | |
|Recolor |Planned |Image is currently exported without any recoloring applied. | |

## Textboxes

Textboxes are converted to raster images on export.

This provides great fidelity however text is not selectable in the output document.

|**Feature**|**Supported**|**Comment**|**See Also**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Text Direction |Yes | | |

## OLE Objects

OLE Objects represent embedded content in a Microsoft Word document, such as an embedded Excel or Powerpoint document. The OLE object is dynamic and can be edited or updated through Microsoft Word.

OLE objects are fully preserved when converting within different Word document formats.

OLE objects are saved as images.

There are plans to export using the &lt;object&gt; tag and the type of object which is embedded. This will allow export of embedded objects such as PDF to be exported as working objects.

## Shapes

Shapes are converted to raster images on export.

This provides great fidelity however text is not selectable in the output document.

See the following link in the documentation for further information:

- [HtmlSaveOptions.ScaleImageToShapeSize](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/htmlsaveoptions/properties/scaleimagetoshapesize)

|**Feature**|**Supported**|**Comment**|**See Also**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Lines |Yes |Vector shapes (lines, arrows, callouts etc.) are output in rasterized form. | |
|Basic Shapes |Yes | | |
|Block Arrows |Yes | | |
|Flowcharts |Yes | | |
|Callouts |Yes | | |
|Stars and Banners |Yes | | |
|Group Shape |Yes |All grouped shapes are exported as one image. | |
|Drawing Canvas |Yes | | |
|Signature Line |N/A |HTML does not have any signature line feature. A signature line is exported as a regular image. <br><br>Alternative text on the image of the signature line is exported as "alt=xxx" attribute. | |
|Ink Annotation |Planned |Ink Annotations are exported to all formats as regular images. | |
|Clip Art |Yes | | |
|Diagrams (VML) |Yes |VML graphic format is normally used in pre-OOXML formats such as DOC or RTF. <br><br>It is planned to also export the VML code along with the image to allow proper round-trip. | |
|SmartArt (VML) |Yes | | |
|Charts (VML) |Yes | | |
|Shape Customizations |Yes |Exported as image. | |
|Hyperlink on Shape |Yes |Exported as &lt;img&gt; element wrapped in &lt;a&gt; element with appropriate attributes. | |
|Watermark |N/A |Watermark shapes will be exported as a regular image to HTML at the same level as normal content. This is because there is no native support for watermark in HTML. To increase fidelity, set the watermark wrapping to "Behind Text" so the watermark will appear behind the main document content when exported to HTML. <br><br>Also note that the image will not have the same transparency level as what is applied in Microsoft Word. <br><br>Watermarks are only exported if the export of headers and footers to HTML is enabled. Since HTML has no "page" concept, the headers and footers only appear once. There is a save option to control how headers and footers are exported to HTML. | |

## WordArt

WordArt is exported as an image. You can also set the AltText property so the plain text content of the WordArt can be found in the output HTML.

|Hyperlink |Planned |&lt;hr&gt; tag can be wrapped in an &lt;a&gt; element. | |
|Image |Yes |Exported as a regular &lt;img&gt; element instead of &lt;hr&gt;. <br><br>There are plans to export a horizontal line with an image as &lt;hr&gt; element with style="background: url(xxx.png)". | |

## Position

|**Feature**|**Supported**|**Comment**|**See Also**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Inline |Yes |Exported as child element child of &lt;p&gt;. | |
|Floating |Yes |Aspose.Words attempts to export floating content to HTML. Note that the output producd may differ greatly from the Word document source as a Word document is a vastly different format. We are activly improving export of floating content in our HTML engine. <br><br>Floating content is made possible by exporting elements with margin-top and margin-left style and position:absolute style. <br><br>In the future we will provide tips on how to design Word documents with floating content that are exported to HTML based formats well. | |
|Wrap Type |Yes |<p>Text wrapping around images and shapes is supported in all formats. <br><br>Wrap type is emulated through the use of "float" on style attribute. </p><p>- Square, Tight and Through are exported as "float:left". </p><p>- Top and Bottom can be emulated by adding &lt;br style="clear:both"&gt; around image but is currently exported as "float:left". </p><p>- Behind-Text can be emulated using z-index:-1 but is currently such content is exported on top of text. </p><p>- Infront of Text content is exported with a z-index greater than 0.</p>| |
|Wrap Sides |Yes |<p>Wrap sides is exported through use of the float style attribute. </p><p>- Both sides and largest only wrap have no suitable analog in HTML and are exported as float:left. </p><p>- Right side wrap is exported as float:left. </p><p>- Left side wrap is exported as float:right.</p>| |
|Distance from Text |Yes |Exported as margin style on exported object. | |
|Z-Order |Yes |Exported as "z-index:X" on style attribute. | |
|Polygon Wrap Points |N/A | | |
|Rotation |Yes |Image is rotated when rendering shape to raster image. | |
|Flip |Yes |Image is flipped when rendering shape to raster image. | |
|Horizontal Alignment |Planned |Currently exported as absolute position. This will be supported in a future version. <br><br>An alternative to achieve the same effect is to make the image inline in a paragraph and set the paragraph alignment to center. | |
|Horizontal Position Relative To |Yes |Always exported as distance from the anchor (paragraph or character). | |
|Vertical Alignment |Planned |Currently exported as absolute position. This will be supported in a future version. | |
|Vertical Position Relative To |Yes |Always exported as distance from the anchor (paragraph or character). | |
|Anchor Lock |N/A | | |
|Allow Overlap |Yes |Floating content can overlap when "Allow Overlap" is enabled. <br><br>When disabled the HTML engine will export these as separate content that does not overlap. | |
|Layout in Table Cell |N/A |Floating content is always exported as distance from the anchor (paragraph or character) regardless of whether the paragraph is in a table or not. | |

## Size
