{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

Each section is exported as separate &lt;div&gt; elements as a child of &lt;body&gt; when there is more than one section in the document. 

If there is only one section then the document content is expoted directly to &lt;body&gt;.

Section-wide formatting is exported as CSS styles on &lt;div&gt;.

{{% /alert %}} 

## Headers and Footers

There is a save option that controls how headers and footers are output. This controls how the primary header is exported in different places in the output document.

By default the header of the first section is exported at the top of the HTML output and the last footer of the last section is output at the end of the HTML output. Any linked headers and footers are taken into account.

When embedded or external style sheet is set, regular paragraphs in the header or footer are exported with "Header" or "Footer" style.

See the following link in the documentation for further information:

## Section Break Type

Section breaks are exported as a &lt;br&gt; tag which contains the special Microsoft Office attribute mso-break-type:section-break.

There is an option to skip exporting breaks to HTML at all.

Note that when exporting to EPUB such break elements are normally ignored by most EPUB readers. Instead use the DocumentSplit option to split the internal HTML of the EPUB at each page break. This will appear correctly in almost all readers. 

See the following links in the documentation for further information:

- [DocumentBuilder.InsertBreak](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/methods/insertbreak)

## Text Columns

HTML and EPUB have no native support for text columns.

Support for this feature may be possible in a future version using CSS3 or EPUB 3.0 features.

## Page Margins

Page settings are output optionally to HTML though the use of a save option. This is exported either as an embedded or external style sheet depending on the save option used.

Section formatting is exported using the "@page" identifier along with margin and size attributes that defines the appearance of the section as seen in the source document.

Some features need Microsoft Office specific attributes, they are not currently supported.
