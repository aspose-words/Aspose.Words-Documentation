## General Formatting

There is a setting to export paragraph styles and formatting as inline CSS (style) only, or as a mix of inline and embedded or linked CSS style sheet (class).

Direct formatting on the paragraph (from ParagraphFormat) is exported as inline CSS (using the style attribute).

Style properties (the style applied in ParagraphFormat.Style) are exported as class styles when the appropriate save option is set and referenced using an embedded or external style sheet (using the class attribute). If inline styles only are exported then all formatting appears on the style attribute.

|Feature|Supported|Comment|See Also|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Paragraph Style|Yes|Note that to properly round-trip styles back to a word document format, an embedded or external style sheet must be used. On HTML import classes defined in the stylesheets are used to create styles. If there is no linked style sheet of either of these kinds then the document is imported with no styles (apart from default Normal style). <br><br>There are plans to provide a safe option to save a document to HTML as pure HTML without CSS styles.|- **HtmlSaveOptions.CssStyleSheetType**|

|Text Frames|Yes| | |

## Tab Stops

Tab stops are not natively available in HTML. Aspose.Words converts tab stops into a fixed set of non-breaking spaces.

Will be improved later by simulating the correct width. Consider using a borderless table to layout information instead of tab stops when export to HTML is required.

|Absolute Position|Planned| | |
|Relative Position|Planned|Can be simulated by calculating the actual position of the tab stop.| |
|Alignment: Left, Center, Right, Decimal, Bar|Planned| | |
|Leader|Planned|Leader characters are currently not exported to HTML.| |

## Drop Caps

A drop cap is a frame which is exported to HTML as a paragraph with borders.

Visually the drop cap looks correct but the main text is moved to the next paragraph. This will be improved when the support of text frames is improved.
