Note that not all Microsoft Word document features are available in HTML format and some features may be lost or converted to an image.

If you are looking for a way to easily store documents in a database then it is suggested to use the WordML or FlatOPC format. Both formats are fully XML-based making them easy to store into a database but they are native word formats which allows you to preserve full fidelity of Microsoft Word features such as WordArt, Textboxex etc.

Aspose.Words saves any loaded document that to valid HTML 4.0 or XHTML 1.0 specifications. EPUB documents are exported as EPUB 2.0. There are plans to support HTML 5 and EPUB 3.0 specification as well. There are also numerous save options available to control a document is exported to HTML. Here some examples of what you can do:

Control the CSS style sheet type

- Specify the directory or streams where images should be saved to.
- Specify where how the URL for an image is constructed.
- Split the internal HTML files when saving to HTML or EPUB to restrict HTML part size to less than 300kb. Some eReaders open EPUB files that have HTML files greater than this size slowly or not at all. Therefore it is recommended to export EPUBs using this option to allow all devices to read the file easily and correctly.
- Export images as embedded Base64.
- Export font size in relative units (em).
- Save fonts with the HTML output.

Some features which are unsupported in HTML are exported as an image. It is Aspose.Words rendering engine takes care of rendering the feature to the image. In such cases, the level of support for this rendered feature can be found under the "Save to Image Format" supported features section.

You can also choose to create your own HTML writer for your own custom needs by building off the Aspose.Words rich DOM. Using the DocumentVisitor you can visit each node and build the HTML node by node.

Currently, most of the special Microsoft "Mso" attributes, which are normally added by Microsoft Word to HTML output to make it round-trip capable back to Word formats, are not written during export to HTML or MHTML. This makes the HTML produced by Aspose.Words much cleaner than the output produced by Microsoft Word which is often bloated with these many round-trip based attributes.

In the future, we will add full support for these in import and allow an option to export control if these attributes are written at all during export.
