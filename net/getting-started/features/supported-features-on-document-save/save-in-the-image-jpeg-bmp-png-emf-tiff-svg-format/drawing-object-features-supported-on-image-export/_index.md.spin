## Position

|**Feature**|**Supported**|**Comment**|**See Also**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Inline |Yes | | |
|Floating |Yes |Floating content is exported well during rendering. <br><br>Currently floating shapes may not be properly positioned when anchor is nested in a cell, belongs to a wrapped line or belongs to a paragraph with first/hanging indents, or to a 2nd column on the page, and other advanced layouts. This may cause some content to overlap in the rendered output. <br><br>This is being worked on and improvements are included with each release. | |
|Wrap Type |Yes |<p>Text wrapping around images and shapes is supported in all formats. <br><br>The following wrap types are fully supported upon rendering: </p><p>- Square </p><p>- Top and Bottom </p><p>- Behind Text </p><p>- Infront of Text </p><p>- Inline with Text <br><br>  The following wrap types are currently unsupported: </p><p>- Tight </p><p>- Through <br><br>  These wrap types are rare and most of the time do not have any visible difference when compared to Square wrapping. The only time you really see differences if text is wrapped around complex objects e.g a Star shaped AutoShape. <br><br>  These two wrap types will be supported in a future version. Currently they are exported as "Square" wrapping which produces very close output. </p>| |
|Wrap Sides |Planned |Both sides is the only Wrap Sides option supported at the moment. <br><br>Other types such as Left Only, Right Only, Largest Only are currently unsupported as are exported as "Both sides" wrapping. <br><br>These wrap types will be supported in a future version. | |
