Not all Microsoft Word features can be exported to OpenDocument format. When a feature is unsupported in ODT Aspose.Words API attempts to export the feature as close as possible using the available features of OpenDocument.

There is a save option which allows you to specify that Aspose.Word should export a document to ODT while strictly following the ODT 1.1 specification.

Note that there may appear to be more styles in the output ODT document than in the original input document. This is expected as all formatting in the ODT format is style based, therefore more styles must be created during export to deal with direct formatting on runs and paragraphs (that are not applied using a style).

See the following links in the documentation for further information:
