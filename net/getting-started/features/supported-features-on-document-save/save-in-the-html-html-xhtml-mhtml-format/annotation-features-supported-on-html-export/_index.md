## Bookmarks

All Word documents and most other formats that Aspose.Words export to only allow bookmarks with unique names, that is, no two bookmarks are allowed the exact same name.

If two bookmarks are given the same name in the model then no errors will occur. During export to any format, the duplicate bookmarks are removed silently. The first bookmark visited in the model is the one that is retained, any other bookmarks are removed,

Bookmark is represented by &lt;a&gt; element. The only bookmark start is output. Nesting and overlapping are not allowed.
