Any document loaded into Aspose.Words can be converted to PDF that conforms to the PDF 1.5 or PDF/A-1b specification. Support for PDF/A-1a specification is planned.

Aspose.Words provides one of the highest fidelity Word document to PDF conversion around. Many document features are exported to PDF exactly as how they appear in the original document.

You can also sign a PDF document and specify permissions such as allowing copying, modification or printing of the PDF document.

Aspose.Words also provides save options to control how PDF generation is handled. The following is some examples of such options:

- Export bookmarks or heading styles to the document outline (navigation pane) in PDF.
- Specify the page range only to export.
- Specify if the PDF uses core or windows fonts (can be used to decrease PDF size).
- Set JPEG quality used during rendering.
- Specifiying text compression used

Both TrueType and OpenFont font formats are supported and can be subsetted during rendering to PDF.
