{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

When converting to a document format that doesn't support custom markup features, the markup is stripped but content is preserved. The non-Microsoft Word document formats do not support custom markup and only text is exported.

## Content Controls (Structured Document Tags)

Currently Content Controls linked to Custom XML Data Storage are not supported during export. The default value of the tag is exported instead. This may make the output appear different to how the content control appears in Microsoft Word.

There are plans to export structure document tags to PDF for enhanced accessibility. The controls are exported as HTML which can be read and interpreted by screen readers
