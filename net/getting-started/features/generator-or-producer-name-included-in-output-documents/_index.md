You can easily know if a document is produced by using Aspose.Words for .NET. You can also find the version number of Aspose.Words for .NET that was used to create a particular output document. Aspose.Words directly writes this information into the generated document.

The version number is specified in the format *YY.M.N* or *YY.MM.N*, for example, 20.12.0 or 21.1.0.<br />
Here *YY* is the last two digits of the release year, *M* or *MM* is the release month (1–12), and *N* is the minor release number. Usually, *N* is "0".
