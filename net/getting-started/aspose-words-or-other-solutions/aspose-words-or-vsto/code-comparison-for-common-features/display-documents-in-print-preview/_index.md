## VSTO Words

Below is the code to show Print Preview of the document.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
this.Application.ActiveDocument.PrintPreview();
{{< /highlight >}}

## Aspose.Words

The Aspose.Words component has no built in dialogs or forms, but implements its own version of the .NET **PrintDocument** class which can be passed to a **PrintPreviewDialog** form to print and preview a document .

Aspose.Words defines a special class called [**AsposeWordsPrintDocument**](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.rendering/asposewordsprintdocument) which is a sub class of the .NET **PrintDocument** class . An instance of this object is passed to the **PrintPreviewDialog** class which defines the output to transmit to a printer.

This sample describes how to use these classes to print a document from Aspose.Words with print preview and settings dialog.

Finally, an instance of the PrintPreviewDialog is created. For this example we have implemented a derived version of the PrintPreviewDialog class called ActivePrintPreviewDialog. This custom class is used to move preview dialog on top of all other windows when it is displayed.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
string FileName = "YourFileName.docx";
Document doc = new Document(FileName);
ActivePrintPreviewDialog previewDlg = new ActivePrintPreviewDialog();

// Pass the Aspose.Words print document to the Print Preview dialog.
previewDlg.Document = doc;

// Specify additional parameters of the Print Preview dialog.
previewDlg.ShowInTaskbar = true;
previewDlg.MinimizeBox = true;
previewDlg.PrintPreviewControl.Zoom = 1;
previewDlg.Document.DocumentName = "TestName.doc";
previewDlg.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized;

// Show the appropriately configured Print Preview dialog.
previewDlg.ShowDialog();
{{< /highlight >}}
