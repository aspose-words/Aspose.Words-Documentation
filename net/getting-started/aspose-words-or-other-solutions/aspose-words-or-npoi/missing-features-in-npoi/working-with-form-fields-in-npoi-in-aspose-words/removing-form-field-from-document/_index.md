## Aspose.Words - Removing Form Field from Document

Sometimes it is necessary to remove a field from the document. This may occur when it is to be replaced with a different field type or when the field is no longer needed in the document. For example a TOC field when saving to HTML.
A field inserted into the document using DocumentBuilder.InsertField returns a Field object which provides a convenience method to easily remove the field from the document.

**C#**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
            Document doc = new Document();
            DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
            Field field = builder.InsertField("PAGE");

            // Calling this method completely removes the field from the document.
            field.Remove();
            doc.Save("FormFieldTest.docx");
