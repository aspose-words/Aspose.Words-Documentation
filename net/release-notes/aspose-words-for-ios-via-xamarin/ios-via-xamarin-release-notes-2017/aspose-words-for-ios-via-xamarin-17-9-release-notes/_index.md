## Major Features

Aspose.Words for iOS via Xamarin features can be divided into four main areas:

- Conversions: High quality conversions to and from DOC, OOXML, RTF, WordprocessingML, HTML, MHTML, TXT and OpenDocument formats
- Document Object Model: Programmatic access through a rich API to all document elements and formatting allows to create, modify, extract, copy, split, join, and replace document content
- Rendering: Convert whole documents or pages to PDF, XPS, SVG or SWF for server-side document generation. Also convert document pages to PNG, JPEG or EMF images, render pages to CoreGraphics.CGContext. All with high fidelity - exactly like Microsoft Word® would have done it.
