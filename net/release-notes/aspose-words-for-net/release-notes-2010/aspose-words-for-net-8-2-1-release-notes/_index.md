This is a maintenance release with a number of fixes that many customers will find useful.

The most important changes are:

- VBA document events (On Open, On New and all others) are fully preserved (they were always lost).
- VBA digital signature is always preserved (it was lost under some circumstances in DOC).
- Names of VBA macros are preserved in the Macros Window (they were sometimes lost).
- Toolbar customizations and custom toolbars are fully preserved.
- Keyboard customizations are fully preserved.

The above changes affect DOC, DOCX and WordprocessingML 2003 formats in Aspose.Words.
