- List styles are fully supported during load, save and copy between DOC files. Note there is still no rich public API to deal with list formatting, but this feature is a prerequisite step towards it.
  Added CompositeNode.GetChildNodes that returns either "live" or "dead" collection of nodes. Before that all returned collections were live. 
  Added a bit more code examples to the API Reference. 
- Aspose.Words.Viewer Beta throws an exception when you attempt to print. 
  Fixed handling of the "rowspan" attribute during HTML import.
