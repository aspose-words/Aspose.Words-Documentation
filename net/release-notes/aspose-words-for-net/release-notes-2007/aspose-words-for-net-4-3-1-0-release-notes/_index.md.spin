This hot fix mainly improves reading of inconsistent/corrupted DOC files such as resumes. For more info on this see end of the post.

Although this release includes a lot of fixes, most of them are actually for a single customer of ours, who uses Aspose.Words heavily in processing of resumes.

Some categories of DOC files (for example resumes) tend to contain a lot internal format inconsistencies, such as references to non-existant lists, malformed tables and so on. It is hard for me to explain why, but resumes are notoriously bad DOC files. Probably people create them in all sorts of obscure applications that claim to produce Microsoft Word documents.

When Aspose.Words DOC reader was first designed almost four years ago, it was built as a "strict" reader. This means that if Aspose.Words detected an inconsistency, it would throw an exception to fail quickly and loudly. The message given would be along the lines of "please send this file to us for research". This was a necessity because the DOC format is not completely documented.

We observed that Microsoft Word 2003 opening internally inconsistent DOC file was very forgiving. We wanted to allow the same in Aspose.Words. Gradually, as we learned more about the DOC format, we started to make the DOC reader in Aspose.Words smarter. We started adding "resiliency" code that was able to automatically correct for some inconsistencies in the DOC files and read the document successfully. 

This hot fix adds a great deal more of resiliency in the import of DOC files in Aspose.Words.
