## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 16.7.0. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added Public Methods to the DigitalSignatureUtil Class that Allow to Specify a Password for Decrypting Document before it will be Signed.

WORDSNET-13735 is resolved and we have added following static methods for signing encrypted documents:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public static void Sign(string srcFileName, string dstFileName, CertificateHolder certHolder, string comments, DateTime signTime, string srcPassword);
public static void Sign(Stream srcStream, Stream dstStream, CertificateHolder certHolder, string comments, DateTime signTime, string srcPassword);
{{< /highlight >}}

Methods sign source file or stream using given certificate holder and writes signed document to destination file/stream.
In the last parameter you can specify a password for decrypting source document. If document is not encrypted this parameter will be ignored.
Also, this is meaningful only if source document has **DOCX** format.

**UC1 (working with file)**

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Create certificate holder from a file.
CertificateHolder cert = CertificateHolder.Create("certFileName", "certPassword");

// Digitally sign encrypted with "docPassword" document in the specified path.
DigitalSignatureUtil.Sign("srcDocFileName", "signedDocFileName", cert, "Comment", DateTime.Now, "docPassword");

// Open encrypted document from a file.
Document signedDoc = new Document("signedDocFileName", new LoadOptions("docPassword"));

// Check that encrypted document was successfully signed.
DigitalSignatureCollection signatures = doc.DigitalSignatures;
if (signatures.IsValid && (signatures.Count > 0))
  Console.WriteLine("The document was signed successfully.")
{{< /highlight >}}

UC2 (working with stream)

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Create certificate holder from a file.
CertificateHolder cert = CertificateHolder.Create("certFileName", "certPassword");

// Digitally sign encrypted with "docPassword" document in the specified stream.
DigitalSignatureUtil.Sign(srcDocStream, signedDocStream, cert, "Comment", DateTime.Now, "docPassword");

// Open encrypted document from a stream.
Document signedDoc = new Document("signedDocStream", new LoadOptions("docPassword"));

// Check that encrypted document was successfully signed.
DigitalSignatureCollection signatures = doc.DigitalSignatures;
if (signatures.IsValid && (signatures.Count > 0))
  Console.WriteLine("The document was signed successfully.")
{{< /highlight >}}

### A Document Page can now be Saved in GIF Format

The document page can now be saved into GIF format just like any other image formats. A new 'Gif' member is added into 'SaveFormat' enum.

Aspose.Words for .Net uses standard GIF codec provided by GDI+. Aspose.Words for Java uses standard GIF codec provided by ImageIO.

Sample code:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Open some document.
Document doc = new Document("mydocument.docx");

// Save the second page as GIF image.
ImageSaveOptions saveOptions = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Gif);
saveOptions.PageIndex = 1;
doc.Save("mydocument.gif", saveOptions);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Exposed more String and Number Formats for Expression Results in LINQ Reporting Engine

The ["Outputting Expression Results"](https://docs.aspose.com/words/net/template-syntax/#outputting-expression-results) section of the engine's documentation was updated to describe the change.

### MsWordVersion Enum Moved to Aspose.Words.Settings

Customers will now have to use 

{{< highlight csharp >}}
using Aspose.Words.Settings;
{{< /highlight >}}

to work with MsWordVersion.

This however should not be a breaking change as presently CompatibilityOptions.OptimizeFor is the only method that uses MsWordVersion enum and is already a member of Aspose.Words.Settings namespace.

### ReplaceAction, IReplacingCallback and ReplacingArgs Moved to Aspose.Words.Replacing

During WORDSNET-1252 implementation we decided to create new namespace Aspose.Words.Replacing and move classes related to find/replace operations to this new namespace.

### WORDSNET-1252. Advanced replace methods

Two methods were added to class Range to support advanced find/replace operations.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public int Replace(string pattern, string replacement, FindReplaceOptions options)
public int Replace(Regex pattern, string replacement, FindReplaceOptions options)
{{< /highlight >}}

These methods support breaks in both search pattern and replacement string. Customer needs to use special meta-characters to specify breaks: &p for paragraph break, &b for section break, &m for page break and &l for manual line break.Also new FindReplaceOptions class was introduced to hold all find/replace options. Most notable member of this class is ApplyFont/ApplyParagraphFormat. It allow to specify text/paragraph formatting to be applied to replacement text.

Below are couple examples.

**UC1**

Demonstrate how breaks support works. In this example we replace certain paragraph breaks with new paragraph breaks + some underline while make it centered. Additionally we replace custom text tag with section break.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.Font.Name = "Arial";
builder.Writeln("First section");
builder.Writeln("  1st paragraph");
builder.Writeln("  2nd paragraph");
builder.Writeln("{insert-section}");
builder.Writeln("Second section");
builder.Writeln("  1st paragraph");
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions();
options.ApplyParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center;

// Double each paragraph break after word "section", add kind of underline and make it centered.
int count = doc.Range.Replace("section&p", "section&p----------------------&p", options);

// Insert section break instead of custom text tag.
count = doc.Range.Replace("{insert-section}", "&b", options);
{{< /highlight >}}

**UC2**

Demonstrates usage of apply formatting and customer callback. In this example we replace numbers with their hexadecimal representations while make them highlighted with color.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.Font.Name = "Arial";
builder.Write("There are few numbers that should be converted to HEX and highlighted: 123, 456, 789 and 17379.");
FindReplaceOptions options = new FindReplaceOptions();

// Highlight newly inserted content.
options.ApplyFont.HighlightColor = Color.DarkOrange;
options.ReplacingCallback = new NumberHexer();
int count = doc.Range.Replace(new Regex("[0-9]+"), "", options);

// Customer defined callback.
private class NumberHexer : IReplacingCallback
{
    public ReplaceAction Replacing(ReplacingArgs args)
    {
        // Parse numbers.
        int number = Convert.ToInt32(args.Match.Value);

        // And write it as HEX.
        args.Replacement = string.Format("0x{0:X}", number);
        return ReplaceAction.Replace;
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Some improvements were made to make replace method to be isolated from changes made by customer in callback.

## Deprecated methods

Old Replace methods are left for backward compatibility but marked as obsolete.

We going to remove following methods in this year:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public int Replace(string oldValue, string newValue, bool isMatchCase, bool isMatchWholeWord)
public int Replace(Regex pattern, IReplacingCallback handler, bool isForward)
{{< /highlight >}}

One old method

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public int Replace(Regex pattern, string replacement)
{{< /highlight >}}

continues to work with old code and will be switched to new code eventually.

### WORDSNET-4285 - SKIPIF field supported

This feature has been requested by a few customers and we have it implemented now. SKIPIF field is now updated during mail merge.

### WORDSNET-6205 Added Support for MathML in HTML Export

WORDSNET-6205 is implemented.

Added support for MathML in HTML export.

The following property is added to HtmlSaveOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Controls how OfficeMath objects are exported to HTML, MHTML or EPUB.
/// Default value is <c>HtmlOfficeMathOutputMode.Image</c>.
/// </summary>
public HtmlOfficeMathOutputMode OfficeMathOutputMode
{
    get { return mOfficeMathOutputMode; }
    set { mOfficeMathOutputMode = value; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The following enum is publicly available:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how Aspose.Words exports OfficeMath to HTML, MHTML and EPUB.
/// </summary>
public enum HtmlOfficeMathOutputMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// OfficeMath is converted to HTML as image specified by <img> tag.
    /// </summary>
    Image,
    /// <summary>
    /// OfficeMath is converted to HTML using MathML.
    /// </summary>
    MathML,
    /// <summary>
    /// OfficeMath is converted to HTML as sequence of runs specified by <span> tags.
    /// </summary>
    Text
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Sample output for simple OfficeMath equation exported using HtmlOfficeMathOutputMode.Image value:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
<img src="Test Out.001.png" width="49" height="21" alt="" />
{{< /highlight >}}

Sample output for simple OfficeMath equation exported using HtmlOfficeMathOutputMode.MathML value:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
	<mi>A</mi>
	<mo>=</mo>
	<mi>π</mi>
	<msup>
		<mrow>
			<mi>r</mi>
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
			<mn>2</mn>
		</mrow>
	</msup>
</math>
{{< /highlight >}}

Sample output for simple OfficeMath equation exported using HtmlOfficeMathOutputMode.Text value:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
<span style="font-family:'Cambria Math'">A=π</span><span style="font-family:'Cambria Math'">r</span><span style="font-family:'Cambria Math'">2</span>
{{< /highlight >}}

### WORDSNET-12901 Implemented API for Adding or Removing Embedded Fonts

WORDSNET-12901 is implemented.

Added following properties to FontInfoCollection class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies whether or not to embed TrueType fonts in a document when it is saved.
/// Default value for this property is <b>false</b>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Embedding TrueType fonts allows others to view the document with the same fonts that were used to create it,
/// but may substantially increase the document size.</para>
/// <para>This option works for DOC, DOCX and RTF formats only.</para>
/// </remarks>
public bool EmbedTrueTypeFonts
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// <para>Specifies whether or not to embed System fonts into the document.
/// Default value for this property is <b>false</b>.</para>
/// <para>This option works only when <see cref="EmbedTrueTypeFonts"/> option is set to <b>true</b>.</para>
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Setting this property to <c>True</c> is useful if the user is on an East Asian system
/// and wants to create a document that is readable by others who do not have fonts for that
/// language on their system. For example, a user on a Japanese system could choose to embed the
/// fonts in a document so that the Japanese document would be readable on all systems.
/// </para>
/// <para>This option works for DOC, DOCX and RTF formats only.</para>
/// </remarks>
public bool EmbedSystemFonts
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// <para>Specifies whether or not to save a subset of the embedded TrueType fonts with the document.

### WORDSNET-13817 Font Substitution Rules Improved

Improvement is made in case when specific font is not installed but is embedded into the document and a substitute for this font is assigned.

Previously font substitute was used in this case. Now embedded font is used.
