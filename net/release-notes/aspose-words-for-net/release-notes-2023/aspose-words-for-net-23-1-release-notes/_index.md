    /// </summary>
    public Font Font {get; }
    ...
}

public class ChartDataLabelCollection
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides access to the font formatting of the data labels of the entire series.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Value defined for this property can be overridden for an individual data label with using the
    /// <see cref="ChartDataLabel.Font"/> property.
    /// </remarks>
    public Font Font {get; }
    ...
}

seriesCollection.Clear();

// Add a chart series.
ChartSeries series = seriesCollection.Add(
    "Series 1",
    new string[] { "Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 3", "Category 4", "Category 5" },
    new double[] { 5.5, 2, 3.5, 6, 9 });

// Display data labels.
series.HasDataLabels = true;
ChartDataLabelCollection labels = series.DataLabels;
labels.ShowValue = true;

// Set font size for all labels of the series.
labels.Font.Size = 12;

const int minValueIndex = 1; // Let's use a constant for simplicity.
const int maxValueIndex = 4; // Let's use a constant for simplicity.

// Mark the labels for the max and min values.

public double BackgroundTintAndShade { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to work with shading theme colors. Please see the following code example to learn how to use such properties:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("c:\Documents\TestDocument.docx");

Shading shading = doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph.ParagraphFormat.Shading;
// Gets and sets the values of theme colors.
if (shading.ForegroundPatternThemeColor == ThemeColor.Accent1)
    shading.ForegroundPatternThemeColor = ThemeColor.Dark1;

if (shading.BackgroundPatternThemeColor == ThemeColor.Accent2)
    shading.BackgroundPatternThemeColor = ThemeColor.Dark2;

// Gets and sets the lightens values.
if (shading.ForegroundTintAndShade == 0)
    shading.ForegroundTintAndShade = 0.5;

if (shading.BackgroundTintAndShade == 0)
    shading.BackgroundTintAndShade = -0.2;

doc.Save("output.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property Range.Revisions

Related issue: WORDSNET-24257

A new public property **Revisions** has been added to the **Range** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets a collection of revisions (tracked changes) that exist in this range.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>The returned collection is a "live" collection, which means if you remove parts of a document that contain
/// revisions, the deleted revisions will automatically disappear from this collection.</para>
/// </remarks>
public RevisionCollection Revisions { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

    if (revision.RevisionType == RevisionType.Deletion)
        revision.Accept();
}
// Getting the first section revisions.
doc.FirstSection.Range.Revisions.RejectAll();
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added the ability to generate TOC (table of contents) for AZW3 documents

Related issue: WORDSNET-24389

Now Aspose.Words can generate TOC (table of contents) for AZW3 documents.

Desired depth of TOC can be specified same way as it's done for EPUB documents using the **HtmlSaveOptions.EpubNavigationMapLevel** property.

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to create AZW3 document with a two-level TOC. Please see the following code example to learn how to use such a property:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();

HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Azw3);
options.EpubNavigationMapLevel = 2;

doc.Save(MyDir + "DocumentWithTwoLevelTOC.azw3", options);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added the ability to specify how list items will be written to the Markdown

Related issue: WORDSNET-24544

The following public enumeration is added to **Aspose.Words.Saving** namespace:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how lists are exported into Markdown.
/// </summary>
public enum MarkdownListExportMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Export list items compatible with Markdown syntax.
    /// </summary>
    MarkdownSyntax,

    /// <summary>
    /// Export list items as plain text.
    /// </summary>
    PlainText
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The following public property is added to the **MarkdownSaveOptions** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how list items will be written to the output file.
/// Default value is <see cref="MarkdownListExportMode.MarkdownSyntax"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>When this property is set to <see cref="MarkdownListExportMode.PlainText"/> all list labels are
/// updated using <see cref="Document.UpdateListLabels"/> and exported with their actual values. Such lists
/// can be non-compatible with Markdown format and will be recognized as plain text upon importing in this case.</para>
/// <para>When this property is set to <see cref="MarkdownListExportMode.MarkdownSyntax"/>, writer tries to export
/// list items in manner that allows to numerate list items in automatic mode by Markdown.</para>
/// </remarks>
public MarkdownListExportMode ListExportMode { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to export document with plain text numbering into Markdown. Please see the following code example:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input.docx");

// Set option to export list items as plain text.
MarkdownSaveOptions options = new MarkdownSaveOptions { ListExportMode = MarkdownListExportMode.PlainText };
doc.Save("output.md", options);
{{< /highlight >}}

### HtmlSaveOptions.ScaleImageToShapeSize now also affects grouped raster images

Related issue: WORDSNET-24065

Behavior of the **HtmlSaveOptions.ScaleImageToShapeSize** property was changed to affect groups of raster images.

Previously, **HtmlSaveOptions.ScaleImageToShapeSize** didn't affect grouped raster images and they were always scaled to shape size and were rendered using the resolution value specified in **HtmlSaveOptions.ImageResolution**. If grouped images were high resolution, their quality would reduce considerably because of scaling.

Now Aspose.Words tries to preserve quality of grouped high resolution images. If a group of raster images is saved to HTML and the **HtmlSaveOptions.ScaleImageToShapeSize** property is set to false, Aspose.Words computes max intrinsic resolution among all images in the group and if it is greater than the value specified in **HtmlSaveOptions.ImageResolution**, the group is rendered using the computed increased resolution. This doesn't eliminate scaling completely but reduces its impact on grouped high resolution raster images.

### OfficeMath.EquationXmlEncoding property was marked as obsolete

Related issue: WORDSNET-24770

The **OfficeMath.EquationXmlEncoding** property has been marked as obsolete because it is not intended to be used in the API.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets/sets an encoding that was used to encode equation XML, if this office math object is read from equation XML.
/// </summary>
[Obsolete("Not intended for use in the API")]
public Encoding EquationXmlEncoding
{
    get;
    set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}
