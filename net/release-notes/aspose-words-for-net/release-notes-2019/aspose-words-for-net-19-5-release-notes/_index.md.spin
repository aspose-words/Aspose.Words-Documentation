## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 19.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.


### Added a new overloaded AppendDocument() method with additional ImportFormatOptions parameter

Related issue: WORDSNET-18228.

Added a new overloaded AppendDocument() method into a Document class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Appends the specified document to the end of this document.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="srcDoc">The document to append.</param>
/// <param name="importFormatMode">Specifies how to merge style formatting that clashes.</param>
/// <param name="importFormatOptions">Allows to specify options that affect formatting of a result document.</param>
public void AppendDocument(Document srcDoc, ImportFormatMode importFormatMode, ImportFormatOptions importFormatOptions)
{{< /highlight >}}



It allows to specify an additional options that affect the formatting of a result document.

See additional information under added a new ImportFormatOptions class for more flexible control over importing tasks at [Aspose.Words for .NET 19.4 Release Notes](/words/net/aspose-words-for-net-19-4-release-notes/).



` `**UseCase:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document srcDoc = new Document("source.docx");
Document dstDoc = new Document("destination.docx");
ImportFormatOptions options = new ImportFormatOptions();

// Specify that if numbering clashes in source and destination documents, then a numbering from the source document will be used.
options.KeepSourceNumbering = true;
dstDoc.AppendDocument(srcDoc, ImportFormatMode.UseDestinationStyles, importFormatOptions)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added a new public property Paragraph.BreakIsStyleSeparator

Related issue: WORDSNET-18436.

Added a new public property BreakIsStyleSeparator into a Paragraph class.

{{< highlight html >}}
/// <summary>
/// True if this paragraph break is a Style Separator. A style separator allows one
/// paragraph to consist of parts that have different paragraph styles.
/// </summary>
public bool BreakIsStyleSeparator
{{< /highlight >}}





It allows to identify Style Separator Paragraph.

**UseCase:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Paragraph paragraph;
if (paragraph.BreakIsStyleSeparator)
{
  // Do smth..
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added feature to get font leading (line spacing)

Related to WORDSNET-16734.

The line spacing of a font is the vertical distance between the baselines of two consecutive lines of text. Thus, the line spacing includes the blank space between lines along with the height of the character itself.

The following property was introduced in the Font class to obtain this value:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns line spacing of this font (in points).
/// </summary>
public double LineSpacing { get; }
{{< /highlight >}}



**UseCase:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(new Document());
builder.Font.Name = "Calibri";
builder.Writeln("qText");

// Obtain line spacing.
Font font = builder.Document.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph.Runs[0].Font;
Console.WriteLine($"lineSpacing = {font.LineSpacing}");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Field.DisplayResult property to obtain the fake result

Related issue: WORDSNET-18357

Inspired by WORDSNET-18165, we have decided to add a property that would allow customers to obtain the field's result for fields that do not have a field separator node. We call this "fake result" or display result; MS Word displays it in the document by calculating the field's value on the fly, but there is no such value in the document model

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets the text that represents the displayed field result.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The <see cref="Words.Document.UpdateListLabels"/> method must be called to obtain correct value for the
/// <see cref="FieldListNum"/>, <see cref="FieldAutoNum"/>, <see cref="FieldAutoNumOut"/> and <see cref="FieldAutoNumLgl"/> fields.
/// </remarks>
public string DisplayResult
{{< /highlight >}}



**Usage:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
List<Field> fields = FieldExtractor.ExtractToCollection(document, false);
Assert.AreEqual("111", fields[0].DisplayResult);
Assert.AreEqual("222", fields[1].DisplayResult);
Assert.AreEqual("Multi\rLine\rText", fields[2].DisplayResult);
Assert.AreEqual("%", fields[3].DisplayResult);
Assert.AreEqual("Macro Button Text", fields[4].DisplayResult);
Assert.AreEqual(string.Empty, fields[5].DisplayResult);
document.UpdateListLabels();
Assert.AreEqual("1)", fields[5].DisplayResult);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new StreamFontSource class

Related issue: WORDSNET-16739

Added new StreamFontSource class which allows loading fonts from the stream:



{{< highlight csharp >}}
    /// <summary>
    /// Base class for user-defined stream font source.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>In order to use the stream font source you should create a derived class from the <see cref="StreamFontSource"/>
    /// and provide implementation of the <see cref="OpenFontDataStream"/> method.</para>
    /// 
    /// <para><see cref="OpenFontDataStream"/> method could be called several times. For the first time it will be called 
    /// when Aspose.Words scans the provided font sources to get the list of available fonts. Later it may be called if the
    /// font is used in the document to parse the font data and to embed the font data to some output formats.</para>
    /// 
    /// <para><see cref="StreamFontSource"/> may be useful because it allows to load the font data only when it is required
    /// and not to store it in the memory for the <see cref="FontSettings"/> lifetime.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    public abstract class StreamFontSource : FontSourceBase, IFontData
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Ctor.
        /// </summary>
        protected StreamFontSource()
        {
        }
        /// <summary>
        /// Ctor.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="priority">Font source priority. See the <see cref="FontSourceBase.Priority"/> property description for more information.</param>
        protected StreamFontSource(int priority)
            : base(priority)
        {
        }
        /// <summary>
        /// Returns the type of the font source.
        /// </summary>
        public sealed override FontSourceType Type
        {
            get { return FontSourceType.FontStream; }
        }
        /// <summary>
        /// This method should open the stream with font data on demand.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>Font data stream.</returns>
        /// <remarks>
        /// Aspose.Words will close the stream after reading. There is no need to close it explicitly.
        /// </remarks>
        public abstract Stream OpenFontDataStream();       
    }
{{< /highlight >}}



**UseCase:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
class ResourceSteamFontSourceExample : StreamFontSource
{
    public override Stream OpenFontDataStream()
    {
        return Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream("resourceName");
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight csharp >}}
FontSettings.DefaultInstance.SetFontsSources(new FontSourceBase[] {new SystemFontSource(), new ResourceSteamFontSourceExample()});
{{< /highlight >}}


### Obsolete properties and methods related to font substitution settings was removed from FontSettings class

Obsolete property DefaultFontName was removed from FontSettings class. Please use SubstitutionSettings.DefaultFontSubstitution instead.
Obsolete property EnableFontSubstitution was removed from FontSettings class. Please use SubstitutionSettings.FontInfoSubstitution instead.
Obsolete methods GetFontSubstitutes, SetFontSubstitutes, AddFontSubstitutes was removed from FontSettings class. Please use SubstitutionSettings.TableSubstitution instead.




### WORDSNET-14297 - Provide a method to check if particular Dml text effect is applied

Font.HasDmlEffect() method have been added to check if particular Dml text effect is applied to the Run.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Checks if particular Dml text effect is applied.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="dmlEffectType">Dml text effect type.</param>
/// <returns>True if particular Dml text effect is applied.</returns>
public bool HasDmlEffect(TextDmlEffect dmlEffectType)
{{< /highlight >}}



**UseCase:**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
RunCollection runs = doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph.Runs;
Font runFont = runs[1].Font;

// One run might have several Dml text effects applied.
Debug.WriteLine(runFont.HasDmlEffect(TextDmlEffect.Shadow));
Debug.WriteLine(runFont.HasDmlEffect(TextDmlEffect.Effect3D));
Debug.WriteLine(runFont.HasDmlEffect(TextDmlEffect.Reflection));
Debug.WriteLine(runFont.HasDmlEffect(TextDmlEffect.Outline));
Debug.WriteLine(runFont.HasDmlEffect(TextDmlEffect.Fill));
{{< /highlight >}}
