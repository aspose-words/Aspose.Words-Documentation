## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 19.8. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.


### Implemented an option that allows to specify whether to work with the original or revised version of a document

Related issues: WORDSNET-18903, WORDSNET-18922.

The new public enumeration was added:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Allows to specify whether to work with the original or revised version of a document.
/// </summary>
public enum RevisionsView
{{< /highlight >}}

Added new public option into Document class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value indicating whether to work with the original or revised version of a document.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The default value is <b><see cref="Aspose.Words.RevisionsView.Original"/></b>.
/// </remarks>
public RevisionsView RevisionsView
{{< /highlight >}}


#### Use Case. Explains how to access the revised version of a document:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(@"test.docx");
doc.UpdateListLabels();

// Switch to the revised version of the document.
doc.RevisionsView = RevisionsView.Final;
foreach (Revision revision in doc.Revisions)
{
    if (revision.ParentNode.NodeType == NodeType.Paragraph)
    {
        Paragraph paragraph = (Paragraph)revision.ParentNode;
        if (paragraph.IsListItem)
        {
            // Print revised version of LabelString and ListLevel.
            Console.WriteLine(paragraph.ListLabel.LabelString);
            Console.WriteLine(paragraph.ListFormat.ListLevel);
        }
    }
}
