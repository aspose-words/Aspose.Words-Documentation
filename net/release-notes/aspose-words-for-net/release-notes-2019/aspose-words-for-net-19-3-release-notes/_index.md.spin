## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 19.3. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added feature to preserve the representation of legacy control characters while converting to OOXML formats

Related issue: WORDSNET-18081 has now been resolved.

New public property was added to the OoxmlSaveOptions class:



{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Keeps original representation of legacy control characters.
/// </summary>
public bool KeepLegacyControlChars
{
    get { return mKeepLegacyControlChars; }
    set { mKeepLegacyControlChars = value; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}



Some formats support legacy control characters. Word does not save these symbols to DOCX format (more accurately in OOXML formats). However, there is a customer request to preserve such control characters. Therefore the setting above was introduced. So far only one legacy character (ShortDateTime) is supported which declared in the "DOC" format.

**Use Case:**



{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("document.doc");
OoxmlSaveOptions so = new OoxmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.FlatOpc);
so.KeepLegacyControlChars = true;
doc.Save("document.docx", so);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added predefined font fallback settings for Google Noto fonts

Related issue: WORDSNET-17329 has now been resolved:

Added predefined font fallback settings for Google Noto fonts. These are free fonts licensed under [SIL OFL](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL). They can be downloaded [from here](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).



{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class FontFallbackSetting
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Loads predefined fallback settings which uses Google Noto fonts.
    /// </summary>
    public void LoadNotoFallbackSettings();
}
{{< /highlight >}}



**Note:** Only Sans style Noto fonts with regular weight are used in the predefined settings.

**Note:** Some of the Noto fonts uses advanced typography features. Advanced typography is currently not supported by AW and these fonts may be rendered inaccurately.

### Changed default value for TxtSaveOptions.AddBidiMarks property from 'true' to 'false'

Related issue: WORDSNET-17853 has now been resolved.

The default value for public property TxtSaveOptions.AddBidiMarks was changed from *true* to *false*:



{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// <para>Specifies whether to add bi-directional marks before each BiDi run when exporting in plain text format.</para>
/// <para>The default value is <b>false</b>.</para>
/// </summary>
public bool AddBidiMarks
{{< /highlight >}}




This is now the same as the corresponding option in Word.

### TxtSaveOptions.ListIndentation option is introduced that allows specifying how list levels are indented when exporting to a plain text format

Related issue: WORDSNET-17778 has now been resolved.

The following public class is introduced that allows to specify how list levels are indented when exporting to a plain text format:



{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies how list levels are indented when document is exporting to SaveFormat.Text format.
/// </summary>
public class TxtListIndentation
{{< /highlight >}}




It has two public properties for specifying how many and which character to use for indentation of list levels:



{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets how many <see cref="Character"/> to use as indentation per one list level.
/// The default value is 0, that means no indentation.
/// </summary>
public int Count
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets which character to use for indenting list levels.
/// The default value is '\0', that means there is no indentation.
/// </summary>
public char Character
{{< /highlight >}}





At last, a new option is added to the TxtSaveOptions class:



{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets a ListIndentation object that specifies how many and which character to use for indentation of list levels.
/// By default it is zero count of character '\0', that means no indentation.
/// </summary>
public TxtListIndentation ListIndentation
{{< /highlight >}}


#### UseCase1: Use one tab character per level for list indentation:


{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input_document");
TxtSaveOptions options = new TxtSaveOptions();
options.ListIndentation.Count = 1;
options.ListIndentation.Character = '\t';
doc.Save("output.txt", options);
{{< /highlight >}}


##### UseCase2: Use three spaces indentation level for list indentation:


{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input_document");
TxtSaveOptions options = new TxtSaveOptions();
options.ListIndentation.Count = 3;
options.ListIndentation.Character = ' ';
doc.Save("output.txt", options);
{{< /highlight >}}


##### UseCase3: Do not use any list level indentation (default behavior):


{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc1 = new Document("input_document");
doc1.Save("output1.txt");
Document doc2 = new Document("input_document");
TxtSaveOptions options = new TxtSaveOptions();
doc2.Save("output2.txt", options);
{{< /highlight >}}

### WORDSNET-18146 - Added public property ChartAxis.TickLabelAlignment

The following new property has been added into the ChartAxis class:



{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets text alignment of axis tick labels.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>This property has effect only for multi-line labels.</para>
/// <para>Default value is <see cref="ParagraphAlignment.Center"/>.</para>.
/// </remarks>
public ParagraphAlignment TickLabelAlignment
{
    get;
    set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}



When axis tick labels are multi-line, MS Word aligns them to the center by default. The property allows for changing this behaviour.

#### UseCase:


{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(fileName);
Shape shape = (Shape)doc.GetChild(NodeType.Shape, 0, true);
ChartAxis axis = shape.Chart.AxisX;
axis.TickLabelAlignment = ParagraphAlignment.Right;
{{< /highlight >}}
