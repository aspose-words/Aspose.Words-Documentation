Hi all,

Please welcome our next regular set of fixes and enhancements.

The major version change from 6.2 to 6.3 is due to the namespace with and classes introduced in the public API. Glossary documents are now supported when loading and saving Office OpenXML only. The work on Glossary Documents is still in progress, I will write about this more in the blog.
