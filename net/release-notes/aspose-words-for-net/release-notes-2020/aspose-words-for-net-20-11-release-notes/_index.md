## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 20.11. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new public properties Document.SpellingChecked and Document.GrammarChecked

Related issue: WORDSNET-13875

Added a new public property Document.SpellingChecked:

A new public property IgnorePrinterMetrics has been added to the LayoutOptions class.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns <b>true</b> if the document has been checked for spelling.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// To recheck the spelling in the document, set this property to <b>false</b>.
/// </remarks>
public bool SpellingChecked
{ 
	get;
	set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Added a new public property Document.GrammarChecked:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Returns <b>true</b> if the document has been checked for grammar.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// To recheck the grammar in the document, set this property to <b>false</b>.
/// </remarks>
public bool GrammarChecked
{ 
	get;
	set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(fileName);
// Verifying if this document has been checked for spelling or grammar.
if (doc.SpellingChecked || doc.GrammarChecked)
{
	// The string with spelling errors.
	doc.FirstSection.Body.FirstParagraph.FirstRun.Text = "The speeling in this documentz is all broked";
	// Spelling check start. 
	doc.SpellingChecked = false; 
	// Grammar check start. 
	doc.GrammarChecked = false;
}
doc.Save(outFileName);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Changes in API of chart data points
The following changes in chart data points API have been implemented (WORDSNET-18874):

- The this property of the ChartDataPointCollection class has been changed to automatically create a data point if it does not exist yet. In the past, a point representing default data point properties was returned at this case.
- The Count property of the ChartDataPointCollection class has been changed to return a number of all data points of series, not just those that have non-default formatting, as it was in the previous versions of the software.
- The enumerator of the ChartDataPointCollection class has been changed to go through all data points of a series, not just those with non-default formatting.
- The ClearFormat method has been added to the ChartDataPointCollection class.
- The ClearFormat method has been added to the ChartDataPoint class.
- The Add, RemoveAt and Clear methods have been marked as obsolete. The collection contains all data points of series now and there is no need to add points to it. The RemoveAt and Clear methods actually reset the formatting of data point(s) to default values, so the ClearFormat methods can be used instead.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class ChartDataPointCollection
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Adds new <see cref="ChartDataPoint"/> at the specified index.
	/// </summary>
	[Obsolete("All data points are available in this collection.")]
	public ChartDataPoint Add(int index);

	/// <summary>
	/// Clears format of a <see cref="ChartDataPoint"/> at the specified index.
	/// </summary>
	[Obsolete("Use the ChartDataPoint.ClearFormat method instead.")]
	public void RemoveAt(int index);

	/// <summary>
	/// Clears format of all <see cref="ChartDataPoint"/> in this collection.
	/// </summary>
	[Obsolete("Use the ClearFormat method instead.")]
	public void Clear();

	/// <summary>
	/// Clears format of all <see cref="ChartDataPoint"/> in this collection.
	/// </summary>
	public void ClearFormat();
}

public class ChartDataPoint
{
	/// <summary>
	/// Clears format of this data point. The properties are set to the default values defined in the parent series.
	/// </summary>
	public void ClearFormat();
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Line, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;

// Delete default generated series.
chart.Series.Clear();

ChartSeries series = chart.Series.Add("Series 1",
	new string[] { "Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 3" },
	new double[] { 1, 5, 4 });

series.Marker.Symbol = MarkerSymbol.Square;
series.Marker.Size = 10;

series.DataPoints[1].Marker.Symbol = MarkerSymbol.Circle;
series.DataPoints[1].Marker.Size = 15;

doc.Save(dir + "DataPoints.docx");

### Aspose.Words now retains hyperlinks in the output PDF (breaking change)
Reference: WORDSNET-21281

In the past, we satisfied a customer's request for removing HYPERLINK fields in TOC field result when the MailMergeCleanupOptions.RemoveStaticFields option is specified. However, MS Word retains them, and an ES customer asked us to change Aspose.Words' behaviour accordingly (WORDSNET-21281). We have implemented that in 20.11.

Here is the code snippet for backward compatibility:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
foreach (FieldPageRef field in document.Range.Fields.OfType<FieldPageRef>())
	field.Unlink();

foreach (FieldHyperlink field in document.Range.Fields.OfType<FieldHyperlink>())
{
	HashSet<Inline> hyperlinkNodes = new HashSet<Inline>();
	Node resultNode = field.Separator;
	while (true)
	{
		if (resultNode is Inline inline && inline.Font.StyleIdentifier == StyleIdentifier.Hyperlink)
			hyperlinkNodes.Add(inline);

		if (resultNode == field.End)
			break;

		resultNode = resultNode.NextSibling;
	}

	// Unlink method clears Hyperlink style according to MS Word behaviour.
	field.Unlink();

	foreach (Inline inline in hyperlinkNodes)
		inline.Font.StyleIdentifier = StyleIdentifier.Hyperlink;
}
