## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.3. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added saving to PDF 2.0 and several other improvements in PDF output

Related issue: WORDSNET-23250

1. New value added to PdfCompliance enum
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public enum PdfCompliance
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The output file will comply with the PDF 2.0 (ISO 32000-2) standard.
    /// </summary>
    Pdf20
}
{{< /highlight >}}
2. Improvements in PDF digital signatures
Changed PDF digital signature type from "adbe.pcks7.sha1" to "adbe.pcks7.detached" to fit all supported PDF versions.
Added PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.RipeMD160 value.
PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.Sha1 and PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.Md5 values are marked as obsolete.
Default value for PdfDigitalSignatureDetails.HashAlgorithm changed from PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.Sha512 to PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.Sha256. SHA256 is most popular hashing algorithm, it is strong enough and it is used by default by Adobe Acrobat when signing the document.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public enum PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm
{
    /// <summary>
    /// SHA-1 hash algorithm.
    /// </summary>
    [Obsolete("SHA-1 hash algorithm has been deprecated in latest PDF specification. Please, use the other hash algorithm instead.")]
    Sha1,
    /// <summary>
    /// MD5 hash algorithm.
    /// </summary>
    [Obsolete("MD5 hash algorithm has been deprecated in latest PDF specification. Please, use the other hash algorithm instead.")]
    Md5,
    /// <summary>
    /// RIPEMD-160 hash algorithm.
    /// </summary>
    RipeMD160,
}
 
public class PdfDigitalSignatureDetails
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the hash algorithm.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>The default value is the SHA-256 algorithm.</remarks>
    public PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm HashAlgorithm { get; set; }        
}
{{< /highlight >}}
3. Improvements in PDF encryption
Removed PdfEncryptionAlgorithm enum and encryptionAlgorithm parameter from PdfEncryptionDetails constructor. This is a breaking change.
Now PDF 1.7 output is encrypted with AES-128 encryption algorithm and PDF 2.0 output with AES-256 algorithm.
Updated XML comments on PdfPermissions to fit current algorithms.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class PdfSaveOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the details for encrypting the output PDF document.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>The default value is null and the output document will not be encrypted.
    /// When this property is set to a valid <see cref="PdfEncryptionDetails"/> object,
    /// then the output PDF document will be encrypted.</para>
    /// <para>AES-128 encryption algorithm is used when saving to PDF 1.7 based compliance (including PDF/UA-1).
    /// AES-256 encryption algorithm is used when saving to PDF 2.0 based compliance.</para>
    /// <para>Encryption is prohibited by PDF/A compliance. This option will be ignored when saving to PDF/A.</para>
    /// <para><see cref="PdfPermissions.ContentCopyForAccessibility"/> permission is required by PDF/UA compliance
    /// if the output document is encrypted. This permission will automatically used when saving to PDF/UA.</para>
    /// <para><see cref="PdfPermissions.ContentCopyForAccessibility"/> permission is deprecated in PDF 2.0 format.
    /// This permission will be ignored when saving to PDF 2.0.</para>
    /// </remarks>
    public PdfEncryptionDetails EncryptionDetails { get; set; }
}
 
public class PdfEncryptionDetails
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes an instance of this class.
    /// </summary>
    public PdfEncryptionDetails(string userPassword, string ownerPassword);
}
 
public enum PdfPermissions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Disallows all operations on the PDF document.
    /// This is the default value.
    /// </summary>
    DisallowAll,
    /// <summary>
    /// Allows all operations on the PDF document.
    /// </summary>
    AllowAll,
    /// <summary>
    /// Copy or otherwise extract text and graphics from the document by operations other than that controlled
    /// by <see cref="ContentCopyForAccessibility"/>.
    /// </summary>

    /// </summary>
    ContentCopyForAccessibility,
    /// <summary>
    /// Modify the contents of the document by operations other than those controlled by
    /// <see cref="ModifyAnnotations"/>, <see cref="FillIn"/>, and <see cref="DocumentAssembly"/>.
    /// </summary>
    ModifyContents,

    /// Add or modify text annotations, fill in interactive form fields, and, if <see cref="ModifyContents"/> is
    /// also set, create or modify interactive form fields (including signature fields).
    /// </summary>
    ModifyAnnotations,
    /// <summary>
    /// Fill in existing interactive form fields (including signature fields), even if <see cref="ModifyContents"/>
    /// is clear.
    /// </summary>
    FillIn,
    /// <summary>
    /// Assemble the document (insert, rotate, or delete pages and create document outline items or thumbnail
    /// images), even if <see cref="ModifyContents"/> is clear.
    /// </summary>
    DocumentAssembly,
    /// <summary>
    /// Print the document (possibly not at the highest quality level, depending on whether
    /// <see cref="HighResolutionPrinting"/> is also set).
    /// </summary>
    Printing,
    /// <summary>
    /// Print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the PDF content could be
    /// generated, based on an implementation-dependent algorithm. When this flag is clear (and
    /// <see cref="Printing"/> is set), printing shall be limited to a low-level representation of the appearance,
    /// possibly of degraded quality.
    /// </summary>

4. Several options in PdfSaveOptions cannot be used when saving PDF 2.0

    /// Courier New and Symbol with core PDF Type 1 fonts.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para>Core fonts are not supported when saving to PDF 2.0 format. <c>false</c> value will be used
    /// automatically when saving to PDF 2.0.</para>
    ...
    /// </remarks>
    public bool UseCoreFonts { get; set; }
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a value determining the way <see cref="Document.CustomDocumentProperties"/> are exported to PDF file.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ...
    /// <para><see cref="PdfCustomPropertiesExport.Standard"/> value is not supported when saving to PDF 2.0.
    /// <see cref="PdfCustomPropertiesExport.Metadata"/> will be used instead.
    /// </para>
    /// </remarks>
    public PdfCustomPropertiesExport CustomPropertiesExport { get; set; }
}
