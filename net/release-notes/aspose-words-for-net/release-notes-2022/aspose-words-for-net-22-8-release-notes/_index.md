## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.8. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added support for AZW3 export

Related issue: WORDSNET-3895

Aspose.Words now can export documents to AZW3 file format.

AZW3 (also called KF8) is Amazon Kindle's proprietary e-book file format. AZW3 is essentially a compiled EPUB.

The following publicly visible enum values were added:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
FileFormat.Azw3
SaveFormat.Azw3
{{< /highlight >}}

The use cases for saving a document to AZW3 file format are as follows:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("test.docx");
doc.Save("test.azw3");
{{< /highlight >}}

or
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("test.docx");
HtmlSaveOptions options = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Azw3);
doc.Save("test.azw3", options);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added warnings for accessibility issues when saving to PDFA and PDFUA

Related issue: WORDSNET-23999

PDF/A and PDF/UA format imposes several accessibility requirements related to the document content that cannot be fulfilled during automatic conversion from a document in Word format to PDF. See documentation article for more info. Now warnings are issued for some of these problems. 
The warnings are issued when saving to one of the PDF/A or PDF/UA formats and the issue violates the compliance. 
E.g. the warning about missing document title will be issued when saving to PDF/UA and will not be issued when saving to PDF/A.

All warnings are of WarningType.MinorFormattingLoss and WarningSource.Pdf. Here is the list of new warnings Description values:

- "Document title is missing. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
- "The document contains headings which levels are not consecutive. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
- "There are shapes without alt text in the document. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
- "There are tables without alt text in the document. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
- "There are hyperlinks without alt text in the document. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
- "There are tables without header row/column in the document. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
- "The document contains Unicode PUA characters. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
- "The document contains .notdef glyphs. This violates the compliance requirements. The output document will not be fully compliant."
