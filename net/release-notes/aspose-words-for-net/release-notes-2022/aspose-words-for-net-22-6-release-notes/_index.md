## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added new public constants to RevisionColor enum

Related issue: WORDSNET-23694

Starting from version 2019 of MS Word, it has the ability to set additional colors for revisions.
A new revision color constants have been added.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Represents 0000ff color.
/// </summary>
ClassicBlue,
/// <summary>
/// Represents ff0000 color.
/// </summary>
ClassicRed,
{{< /highlight >}}

Now it is really easy to set new colors for the document revisions.

Use Case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
// Set new color for the insert revisions
doc.LayoutOptions.RevisionOptions.InsertedTextColor = RevisionColor.ClassicBlue;
{{< /highlight >}}

### Changed behavior of Fill.OneColorGradient and Fill.TwoColorGradient methods

Related issue: WORDSNET-22072

The following changes have been implemented:

1. Now the OneColorGradient and TwoColorGradient methods of the Fill class can be used to create gradient fills in charts (see ChartDataPoint.Format.Fill, ChartMarker.Format.Fill and ChartSeries.Format.Fill properties). System.NotImplementedException was thrown in the previous versions.

2. Behavior of the following overloads of the OneColorGradient and TwoColorGradient methods have been changed:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Sets the specified fill to a one-color gradient using the specified color.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="color">The color to build the gradient.</param>
/// <param name="style">The gradient style <see cref="Drawing.GradientStyle"/></param>
/// <param name="variant">The gradient variant <see cref="Drawing.GradientVariant"/></param>
/// <param name="degree">The gradient degree. Can be a value from 0.0 (dark) to 1.0 (light).</param>
public void OneColorGradient(Color color, GradientStyle style, GradientVariant variant, double degree);
 
/// <summary>
/// Sets the specified fill to a two-color gradient.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="color1">The first color to build the gradient.</param>
/// <param name="color2">The second color to build the gradient.</param>
/// <param name="style">The gradient style <see cref="Drawing.GradientStyle"/>.</param>
/// <param name="variant">The gradient variant <see cref="Drawing.GradientVariant"/></param>
public void TwoColorGradient(Color color1, Color color2, GradientStyle style, GradientVariant variant);
{{< /highlight >}}

In the past, their behavior was as if a gradient was created using the overloads without specifying colors, and then fore and back color were set. Now the behavior is reversed: as if you first define the colors, and then using the overloads to build the gradient.

### Removed obsolete PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm enum values

Related issue: WORDSNET-23473

Removed obsolete PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm enum values Sha1 and Md5.

SHA1 and MD5 hash algorithms for digital signature are deprecated in the latest PDF specification due to security issues. So, please, use the one of the available algorithms instead.

### Removed obsolete properties of ChartDataPointCollection and ChartDataLabelCollection classes

Related issue: WORDSNET-23633

The following obsolete methods have been removed:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class ChartDataLabelCollection
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds new <see cref="ChartDataLabel"/> at the specified index.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="index">Target data label index.</param>
    [Obsolete("When ChartSeries.HasDataLabels is 'true', all data labels are available in this collection.")]
    public ChartDataLabel Add(int index);
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Clears format of a <see cref="ChartDataLabel"/> at the specified index.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="index">The zero-based index of the chart data label to clear format.</param>
    [Obsolete("Use the ChartDataLabel.ClearFormat method instead.")]
    public void RemoveAt(int index);
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Clears format of all <see cref="ChartDataLabel"/> in this collection.
    /// </summary>
    [Obsolete("Use the ClearFormat method instead.")]
    public void Clear();
}
 
public class ChartDataPointCollection
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds new <see cref="ChartDataPoint"/> at the specified index.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="index">Target data point index.</param>
    [Obsolete("All data points are available in this collection.")]
    public ChartDataPoint Add(int index);
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Clears format of a <see cref="ChartDataPoint"/> at the specified index.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="index">The zero-based index of the data point to clear format.</param>
    [Obsolete("Use the ChartDataPoint.ClearFormat method instead.")]
    public void RemoveAt(int index);
 
    /// <summary>
    /// Clears format of all <see cref="ChartDataPoint"/> in this collection.
    /// </summary>
    [Obsolete("Use the ClearFormat method instead.")]
    public void Clear();
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new class for saving PDFs to other fixed formats

Related feature task: WORDSNET-23059

We've added a new way to work with PDF input files. Now they can be converted into a fixed format without using Words layout model.

I.e. the feature runs without Document class and returns the result in a MemoryStream object.

Example:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
var pdfRenderer = new PdfFixedRenderer();
var options = new PdfFixedOptions() { PageIndex = 0, PageCount = 2 };
var resultStream = pdfRenderer.SavePdfAsHtml(pdfStream, options);
{{< /highlight >}}

Pros:
 - More accurate conversion (positions of text and other elements).
 - Better performance and memory usage (less logic to run, no need to build flow models, etc).

Cons:
 - The list of output formats is limited for now (PDF, Html, XPS, Jpeg, Png, Tiff, Bmp).
 - There is no way to edit the data during the conversion.
 - A small amount of options such as Password, page range and Jpeg image quality.

Supported methods:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
SavePdfAsHtml(...);
SavePdfAsXps(...);
SavePdfAsImages(...);
SavePdfAsPdf(...);
{{< /highlight >}}

Available options:

 - PageIndex and PageCount can be used to select a subset of pages.
 - Password - allows to decode an encrypted PDF. The result would be decrypted.
 - JpegQuality - can be provided before SavePdfAsImages calls to setup output Jpeg image quality.
 - ImageFormat - should be used to specify the output image format for SavePdfAsImages.
 
 All options are optional and can be ommited in favor of default values.
