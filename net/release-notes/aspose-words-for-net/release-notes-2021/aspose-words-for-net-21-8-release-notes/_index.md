## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 21.8. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to insert GIF image into the document

Related issue: WORDSNET-1786

Introduced ability to insert a GIF image into the model using "DocumentBuilder.InsertImage" method.

Limitations:

- Access to the image bytes causes conversion GIF to PNG;

- Saving to formats differ from the DOCX, DOTX, DOCM, DOTM, FOPC causes conversion GIF to PNG;

- DocumentBuilder must be optimized to Word 2007 or higher (Word 2007 is default option).

Use Case: Explains how to insert a GIF image.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
Shape image = builder.InsertImage("image.gif");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new Pdf save option - ExportLanguageToSpanTag

The new save option allows to customize how the Lang entry should be exported. It can be useful for compatibility with some screen readers.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value determining whether or not to create a "Span" tag in the document structure to export the text language.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para> Default value is <c>false</c> and "Lang" attribute is attached to a marked-content sequence in a page content stream.</para>
/// <para> When the value is <c>true</c> "Span" tag is created for the text with non-default language and "Lang" attribute is attached to this tag.</para>
/// <para> This value is ignored when <see cref="ExportDocumentStructure"/> is <c>false</c>. </para>
/// </remarks>
public bool ExportLanguageToSpanTag
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case: 
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
 
PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions();
options.ExportDocumentStructure = true;
options.ExportLanguageToSpanTag = true;
 
doc.Save("output.pdf", options);
{{< /highlight >}}

### Implemented field updating public callback

Related issue: WORDSNET-22408

As a part of customer driven development, we have implemented a field updating public callback interface:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Implement this interface if you want to have your own custom methods called during a field update.
/// </summary>
public interface IFieldUpdatingCallback
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A user defined method that is called just before a field is updated.
    /// </summary>
    void FieldUpdating(Field field);
 
    /// <summary>
    /// A user defined method that is called just after a field is updated.
    /// </summary>
    void FieldUpdated(Field field);
}
{{< /highlight >}}

And a FieldOptions property:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets <see cref="IFieldUpdatingCallback"/> implementation
/// </summary>
public IFieldUpdatingCallback FieldUpdatingCallback { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

Use case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
document.FieldOptions.FieldUpdatingCallback = new FieldUpdatingCallback();
 
public class FieldUpdatingCallback : IFieldUpdatingCallback
{
    void IFieldUpdatingCallback.FieldUpdating(Field field)
    {
        // Do something on field updating.
    }
 
    void IFieldUpdatingCallback.FieldUpdated(Field field)
    {
        // Do something on field updated.
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public property SaveOptions.FlatOpcXmlMappingOnly

Related issue: WORDSNET-22507

New public FlatOpcXmlMappingOnly option has been implemented.
{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets value determining which document formats are allowed to be mapped by <see cref="StructuredDocumentTag.XmlMapping"/>.
/// By default only <see cref="LoadFormat.FlatOpc"/> document format is allowed to be mapped.
/// </summary>
public bool FlatOpcXmlMappingOnly { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

By default MS Word allows to bind structured document tags to FlatOpc documents only. 
This option allows to control this behavior and bind documents in any format.

Use case:
{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document("filename"); // a document containing SDT mapped to document, for example, in HTML format
doc.Save("out_1.pdf"); // the default behavior - SDT will contain raw HTML text
 
SaveOptions so = SaveOptions.CreateSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Pdf);
so.FlatOpcXmlMappingOnly = false;

doc.Save("out_2.pdf", so); // mapped HTML will be parsed and resulting document is inserted into SDT content
{{< /highlight >}}
