## Public API and Backwards Incompatible Changes

### DrawingML.GetShapeRenderer Behavior Changed

### ExportEmbeddedSvg Property Added to HtmlFixedSaveOptions

### FirstPageHeaderFooterPerSection Option Added to ExportHeadersFootersMode

### Rendering of DrawingML Glow Effect

- Simplified
  (default) - Soft edges are simulated using several layers with different
  transparency, which gives acceptable result with higher performance than in
  Fine mode.
- Fine -
  Blur filter is applied, which gives the same result as MS Word, but with lower
  performance because of complexity of convolution filter.
- None - In
  this mode no DrawingML effects are rendered.

### Rendering of DrawingML Glow Effect

### ResourceFileUri Property Added to ResourceSavingArgs

- It is
  impossible to provide different aliases for individual resource files. 
- Generated
  URIs have the form "alias/filename", which is fixed. For example, it
  is impossible to change the order of the alias and the file name or remove the
  slash character that separates them.

### SaveOptions.DmlRenderingMode Introduced

### TOC Field Switch to Omit Page Numbers is Supported

### Trackmove Revisions Supported upon DOCX Round-trip
