Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 17.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Public Properties ParagraphFormat.AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndAlpha and ParagraphFormat.AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndDigit

WORDSNET-14376 and WORDSNET-14377 are resolved. Two new public properties are available in the ParagraphFormat class: AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndAlpha and AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndDigit.

Two new public properties are available in the ParagraphFormat class: AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndAlpha and AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndDigit.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a flag indicating whether inter-character spacing is automatically adjusted between regions
/// of Latin text and regions of East Asian text in the current paragraph.
/// </summary>
public bool AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndAlpha { get; set; }
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a flag indicating whether inter-character spacing is automatically adjusted between regions
/// of numbers and regions of East Asian text in the current paragraph.
/// </summary>
public bool AddSpaceBetweenFarEastAndDigit { get; set; }
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Public Property HtmlLoadOptions.PreferredControlType

WORDSNET-14669 has been resolved. New public property PreferredControlType is added into the HtmlLoadOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Type of document nodes that represent &lt;input&gt; and &lt;select&gt; elements imported from HTML.
/// </summary>
public enum HtmlControlType
{
    FormField,
    StructuredDocumentTag
}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets preffered type of document nodes that will represent imported &lt;input&gt; and &lt;select&gt; elements.
/// Default value is <see cref="HtmlControlType.FormField"/>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Please note that setting this property does not guarantee that all imported controls will be of the specified type.
/// If an HTML control is not representable with document nodes of the preferred type, Aspose.Words will use
/// a compatible <see cref="HtmlControlType"/> for that control.
/// </remarks>
public HtmlControlType PreferredControlType
{
    get { return mPreferedControlType; }
    set { mPreferedControlType = value; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Sample usage:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
HtmlLoadOptions lo = new HtmlLoadOptions();
lo.PreferredControlType = HtmlControlType.StructuredDocumentTag;
Document doc = new Document(@"test.html", lo);
{{< /highlight >}}

### WORDSNET-15326 - SVG Multithread Processing Issue Resolved

Upon inserting SVG image into the document, it is converted to meta-file (EMF).When do this in multiple threads exception might occur in GDI+. To prevent problems with multi-threading, we switched to our own EMF renderer instead of GDI+ used earlier.
