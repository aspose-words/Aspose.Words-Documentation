## Aspose.Words for .NET 9.7 Release Notes

It's been just under 4 weeks since the previous release, yet we have another 75 improvements and fixes ready that warrant a new release. The work never stops here and by the time we have one release out, we already have more tasks finished and reviewed ready to go out in the next release. When we think enough customers will be happy to update, we release.

## Important Issues/Features Resolved

- Some documents that contained DrawingML Charts and saved to DOCX by Aspose.Words failed to open in Microsoft Word.

- Output list labels to TXT format.
- Supported creation of PDF documents with access permissions (no copy, no printing etc), use PdfSaveOptions.EncryptionDetails.
