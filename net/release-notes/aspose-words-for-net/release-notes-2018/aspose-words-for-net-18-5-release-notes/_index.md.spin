## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 18.5. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added Public Property StructuredDocumentTag.Color

This property allows to control the ***Color*** of a content control.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the color of the structured document tag.
/// </summary>
public System.Drawing.Color Color
{{< /highlight >}}

The ***Color*** affects content control in two situations:
\1) MSW highlights the background of the content control when the mouse moves over the content control. This helps user to identify that it is a content control.
The color of highlighting is a bit "softer", than the ***Color***. For example, MSW highlights background with the pink color, when ***Color*** is Red.
\2) When user interacts (editing, picking etc) with the content control, the border of content control is colored with the ***Color***.

Example of use:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document(myDir + "document1.docx");
StructuredDocumentTag sdt = (StructuredDocumentTag)doc.GetChild(NodeType.StructuredDocumentTag, 0, true);
sdt.Color = Color.Red;
doc.Save(myDir + "document1.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Obsolete Property HtmlSaveOptions.ExportMetafileAsRaster was Removed

Obsolete property ExportMetafileAsRaster was removed from the HtmlSaveOptions class. Please use the HtmlSaveOptions.MetafileFormat property instead.

### Supported Null-Conditional Operators in Template Expressions for LINQ Reporting Engine

Related issue: WORDSNET-16227

The "[Using Operators](/words/net/template-syntax/#templatesyntax-usingoperators)" section of the engine's documentation was updated to describe the change.
