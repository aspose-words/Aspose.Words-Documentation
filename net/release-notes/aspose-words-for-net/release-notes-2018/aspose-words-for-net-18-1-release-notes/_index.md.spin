## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 18.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Enhanced Support of Single-Column Table Data Bands and Conditional Blocks for LINQ Reporting Engine

Related issues WORDSNET-13863, WORDSNET-15776, WORDSNET-16188.

The "[Working with Table-Row Data Bands](/words/net/template-syntax/#templatesyntax-workingwithtable-rowdatabands)" and "[Working with Table-Row Conditional Blocks](/words/net/template-syntax/#templatesyntax-workingwithtable-rowconditionalblocks)" sections of the engine's documentation were updated to describe the change.

### Remove Obsolete Method in CompositeNode

Removed obsolete public method from CompositeNode class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public NodeCollection GetChildNodes(NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep, bool isLive)
{{< /highlight >}}

Parameter "isLive" is not used anymore. Please use CompositeNode.GetChildNodes(NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep) instead.

### Added the ChartAxis.Hidden Property

Related Issue: WORDSNET-15801

The following public property has been added into the **ChartAxis** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a flag indicating whether this axis is hidden or not.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Default value is false.
/// </remarks>
public bool Hidden
{
    get; set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The property allows hiding/showing and getting visibility state of an axis of a chart.

#### UC to create a chart and hide its Y axis

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert chart.
Shape shape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Column, 432, 252);
Chart chart = shape.Chart;

// Clear demo data.
chart.Series.Clear();

// Fill data.
chart.Series.Add("AW Series 1",
    new string[] { "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", "Item 5" },
    new double[] { 1.2, 0.3, 2.1, 2.9, 4.2 });

// Hide the Y axis.
chart.AxisY.Hidden = true;
doc.Save(dir + "TestHiddenAxis.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Property for Preserving Meta-Characters during Replacement

Related Issue: WORDSNET-15840

We have added public get/set property for preserving meta-characters during replacement as an option in FindReplaceOptions class

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// True indicates that meta-characters beginning with "&" are preserved.

/// Default value is false.

/// </summary>

public bool PreserveMetaCharacters

{{< /highlight >}}

This is useful for example in replacing html text with meta-characters such as "&ldquo" and others

Sample usage

{{< highlight javascript >}}

 var doc = new Document();

var text = "some text";

var replaceWithText = @"&ldquo;some text&rdquo;";

var builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder.Write(text);

doc.Range.Replace(text, replaceWithText,

  new FindReplaceOptions

    {

      PreserveMetaCharacters = true

    }

);

{{< /highlight >}}

### Added Feature to Get StoreItemID Property of StructuredDocumentTag

Related Issue: WORDSNET-16060

As per customer's request, we have made public get property StoreItemId of class XmlMapping:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

 /// <summary>

/// Specifies the custom XML data identifier for the custom XML data part which

/// shall be used to evaluate the <see cref="XPath"/> expression.

/// </summary>

public string StoreItemId

{{< /highlight >}}

More info about storeItemID property: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.databinding(v=office.14).aspx>

Sample usage:

{{< highlight javascript >}}

 var doc = new Document("file.docx");

var sdt = (StructuredDocumentTag) doc.GetChild(NodeType.StructuredDocumentTag, 0, true);

Console.WriteLine("Id = {0}", sdt.XmlMapping.StoreItemId);

{{< /highlight >}}
