## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 18.11. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Removing Colon between Empty MERGEFIELDs

WORDSNET-17386 has now been resolved.

A customer requested a feature supported by Word where you can surround a colon with two merge fields and if both fields are empty then it will also remove the colon. In fact, Aspose.Words removes a paragraph with merge fields if it becomes empty or contains only white-spaces after mail merge, which is controlled by the **MailMergeCleanupOptions.RemoveEmptyParagraphs** option. However, MS Word considers paragraphs with some non-white-space symbols (including colon) empty, while Aspose.Words did not prior to the fix.

We could just hard-code the new Aspose.Words behavior but did not want to introduce something that could be treated as a regression. Given that, we have added another option:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a value indicating whether paragraphs with punctuation marks are considered as empty
/// and should be removed if the <see cref="MailMergeCleanupOptions.RemoveEmptyParagraphs"/> option is specified.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The default value is <c>true</c>.
/// </remarks>
/// <remarks>
/// Here is the complete list of cleanable punctuation marks:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><description>!</description></item>
/// <item><description>,</description></item>
/// <item><description>.</description></item>
/// <item><description>:</description></item>
/// <item><description>;</description></item>
/// <item><description>?</description></item>
/// <item><description>¡</description></item>
/// <item><description>¿</description></item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
public bool CleanupParagraphsWithPunctuationMarks
{
    get { return mCleanupParagraphsWithPunctuationMarks; }
    set { mCleanupParagraphsWithPunctuationMarks = value; }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

*The default value of the option is* ***true*** *which means that the behavior was changed to mimic MS Word; however, the customers who rely on the old behavior are able to revert it by setting the option to* ***false**.*

The following sample demonstrates this case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
document.MailMerge.CleanupOptions = MailMergeCleanupOptions.RemoveEmptyParagraphs;
document.MailMerge.CleanupParagraphsWithPunctuationMarks = false;
document.MailMerge.Execute(new string[] {"field"}, new object[] {null});
{{< /highlight >}}

### Provide TxtSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFootersMode Property

` `New public enum type was added:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Specifies the way headers and footers are exported to plain text format.
public enum TxtExportHeadersFootersMode
{
    // No headers and footers are exported.
    None,

    // Only primary headers and footers are exported at the beginning and end of each section.
    PrimaryOnly,

    // All headers and footers are placed after all section bodies at the very end of a document.
    AllAtEnd
}
{{< /highlight >}}

New public property was added to TxtSaveOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}

// Specifies the way headers and footers are exported to the plain text format.
public TxtExportHeadersFootersMode ExportHeadersFootersMode
{{< /highlight >}}

The main advantage of new property over the old TxtSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFooters property is that it has new headers and footers export mode: 'AllAtEnd'.
In this mode Aspose.Words acts the way similar to MS Word: all headers and footers are placed after all section bodies at the very end of a document.

#### UC

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Document doc = new Document ("inputFileName");
TxtSaveOptions options = new TxtSaveOptions();
options.SaveFormat = SaveFormat.Text;

// All headers and footers are placed at the very end of the output document.
options.ExportHeadersFootersMode = TxtExportHeadersFootersMode.AllAtEnd;
doc.Save("outputFileNameA.txt", options);

// Only primary headers and footers are exported at the beginning and end of each section.
options.ExportHeadersFootersMode = TxtExportHeadersFootersMode.PrimaryOnly;
doc.Save("outputFileNameB.txt", options);

// No headers and footers are exported.
options.ExportHeadersFootersMode = TxtExportHeadersFootersMode.None;
doc.Save("outputFileNameC.txt", options);
{{< /highlight >}}
