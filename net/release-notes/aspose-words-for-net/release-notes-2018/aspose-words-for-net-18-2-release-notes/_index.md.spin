## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 18.2. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Changed Importing Logic with KeepSourceFormatting Mode

Related issue: WORDSNET-14587

The importing logic with KeepSourceFormatting mode is changed to be closer to MS Word behavior.

Before fix we cloned styles with same names to destination document, but now we are expanding source formatting into the direct attributes of imported nodes.

### Support to Insert Style Separator to Put different Paragraph Styles

Related issue: WORDSNET-15943

The following public method has been added into the **DocumentBuilder** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Inserts style separator into the document.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This method allows to apply different paragraph styles to two different parts of a text line.
/// </remarks>
public void InsertStyleSeparator()
{{< /highlight >}}

Style Separator can be added to the end of a paragraph using the* *Ctrl+Alt+Enter Keyboard Shortcut into MS Word. This feature allows for two different paragraph styles used in one logical printed paragraph.

Use case:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(new Document());
Style paraStyle = builder.Document.Styles.Add(StyleType.Paragraph, "MyParaStyle");
paraStyle.Font.Bold = false;
paraStyle.Font.Size =8;
paraStyle.Font.Name ="Arial";

// Append text with "Heading 1" style.
builder.ParagraphFormat.StyleIdentifier = StyleIdentifier.Heading1;
builder.Write("Heading 1");
builder.InsertStyleSeparator();

// Append text with another style.
builder.ParagraphFormat.StyleName = paraStyle.Name;
builder.Write("This is text with some other formatting ");
builder.Document.Save(@"OutDoc.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

### HtmlSaveOptions.MetafileFormat Property Added

Related issue: WORDSNET-15995

The following property has been added to the HtmlSaveOptions class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public class HtmlSaveOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies in what format metafiles are saved when exporting to HTML, MHTML, or EPUB.
    /// Default value is <see cref="HtmlMetafileFormat.Png" />, meaning that metafiles are rendered to raster PNG images.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <p>Metafiles are not natively displayed by HTML browsers. By default, Aspose.Words converts WMF and EMF
    /// images into PNG files when exporting to HTML. Other options are to convert metafiles to SVG images or to export
    /// them as is without conversion.</p>
    /// <p>Some image transforms, in particular image cropping, will not be applied to metafile images if they are exported
    /// to HTML without conversion.</p>
    /// </remarks>
    /// <seealso cref="ImageResolution"/>
    /// <seealso cref="ScaleImageToShapeSize"/>
    public HtmlMetafileFormat MetafileFormat
    {
        get { return mSaveImageOptions.MetafileFormat; }
        set { mSaveImageOptions.MetafileFormat = value; }
    }
}
/// <summary>
/// Indicates the format in which metafiles are saved to HTML documents.
/// </summary>
public enum HtmlMetafileFormat
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Metafiles are rendered to raster PNG images.
    /// </summary>
    Png,
    /// <summary>
    /// Metafiles are converted to vector SVG images.
    /// </summary>
    Svg,
    /// <summary>
    /// Metafiles are saved as is, without conversion.
    /// </summary>
    EmfOrWmf
}
{{< /highlight >}}

The new property replaces HtmlSaveOptions.ExportMetafileAsRaster, which is now marked obsolete. New code should use MetafileFormat instead of ExportMetafileAsRaster, as shown below:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
MetafileFormat = HtmlMetafileFormat.Png;

// Instead of
ExportMetafileAsRaster = true;
MetafileFormat = HtmlMetafileFormat.EmfOrWmf;

// Instead of
ExportMetafileAsRaster = false;
{{< /highlight >}}

The new option value - HtmlMetafileFormat.Svg - is useful in scenarios where a customer imports SVG images to a document and want to save these images back to SVG format, as in the following code sample:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder();
builder.Write("Here is an SVG image: ");
builder.InsertHtml("<svg height='210' width='500'> <polygon points='100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198' style='fill:lime;stroke:purple;stroke-width:5;fill-rule:evenodd;' /></svg> ");
HtmlSaveOptions opts = new HtmlSaveOptions();
opts.MetafileFormat = HtmlMetafileFormat.Svg;
builder.Document.Save("D:\\temp\\out.html", opts);
{{< /highlight >}}

### FontSettings.EnableFontSubstitution Option Added

Related issue: WORDSNET-16315



The following public property has been added into the **FontSettings** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies whether to enable or disable font substitution.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>If font substitution is enabled, Aspose.Words evaluates all the related fields in <see cref="FontInfo"/>
/// (Panose, Sig etc) for the missing font and finds the closest match among the available font sources. Note that
/// font substitution mechanism will override the <see cref="DefaultFontName"/> in cases when <see cref="FontInfo"/>
/// for the missing font is available in the document.</para>
/// <para>If font substitution is disabled, Aspose.Words uses the <see cref="DefaultFontName"/> for the substitution
/// of missing fonts.</para>
/// <para>The default value is <c>true</c>.</para>
/// </remarks>
public bool EnableFontSubstitution
{
    get; set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Shape was not Resized Properly

Related issue: WORDSNET-16362

Behavior of the model while setting of shape height/width was changed. Relative height/width of the shape resets to zero, while changing absolute size. It is the same as MS Word automation does.

For example, the following code, for shape with relative height 20% from "margin", updates relative height to 0 and set absolute value to 150 points:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
Shape shape = (Shape)doc.FirstSection.Body.GetChild(NodeType.Shape, 0, true);
shape.Height = 150;
{{< /highlight >}}

### Obsolete Properties were Removed from HtmlSaveOptions

Then following obsolete properties were removed from the HtmlSaveOptions class:

|Removed property|Property to use instead|
| :- | :- |
|HtmlSaveOptions.AllowNegativeLeftIndent|HtmlSaveOptions.AllowNegativeIndent|
|HtmlSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFooters|HtmlSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFootersMode|

### Obsolete Property HtmlFixedSaveOptions.MetafileRenderingMode was Removed

### Obsolete Property SvgSaveOptions.MetafileRenderingMode was Removed

Obsolete property MetafileRenderingMode was removed from the SvgSaveOptions class. Please use the SvgSaveOptions.MetafileRenderingOptions.RenderingMode property instead.

### Obsolete SWF File Format was Removed from Aspose.Words API

As you may know, Adobe is going to drop support of Flash that is why we decided to remove SaveFormat.Swf from Aspose.Words API.

SaveFormat.Swf was removed.

### Several Obsolete Properties were Removed from XpsSaveOptions Class

Obsolete property XpsSaveOptions.HeadingsOutlineLevels was removed. Please use OutlineOptions.HeadingsOutlineLevels property instead.

Obsolete property XpsSaveOptions.BookmarksOutlineLevel was removed. Please use OutlineOptions.DefaultBookmarksOutlineLevel property instead.
