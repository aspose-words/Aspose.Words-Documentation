## Inserting Fields into a Document using DocumentBuilder

In Aspose.Words the **DocumentBuilder.InsertField** method is used to insert new fields into a document. The first parameter accepts the full field code of the field to be inserted. The second parameter is optional and allows the field result of the field to be set manually. If this is not supplied then the field is updated automatically. You can pass null or empty to this parameter to insert a field with an empty field value. If you are not sure about the particular field code syntax, create the field in Microsoft Word first and switch to see its field code.

{{% alert color="primary" %}} 

If your field code has a parameter containing a space then it must be enclosed within speech marks. Otherwise the field in both Microsoft Word and Aspose.Words may not work as expected as the parameter is treated by both as being truncated

{{% /alert %}}

### Specify Locale at Field Level

A language identifier is a standard international numeric abbreviation for the language in a country or geographical region. With Aspose.Words, you can specify Locale at field level. Field.LocaleId property gets or sets the locale ID of the field. The example below illustrates how to make use of this option.

### Inserting Untyped/Empty Field

If you want to insert untyped/empty fields ({}) just like MS Word allows, you can use DocumentBuilder.InsertField method with parameter FieldType.FieldNone. To insert a field in Word document, you can press “Ctrl + F9” key combination. Below code example shows how to insert an empty field in the document.
