Sometimes you need to add a group shape into a Word document. In Microsoft Word, you can quickly add a group shape using Group command/button. A group shape consists of multiple shapes. Individual shape in a group can be moved separately. In Aspose.Words it is very easy to add a group shape using [GroupShape](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/groupshape) class. Shape is created separately using [Shape](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/shape) class and then added in [GroupShape](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.drawing/groupshape) object using [AppendChild](https://apireference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/compositenode/methods/appendchild) method.
