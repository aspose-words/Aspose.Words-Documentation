Converting documents from one format to another is the flagship feature of Aspose.Words. You can convert documents in any available [load format](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/loadformat/) also to XLSX format.

## Convert a Document to XLSX

Converting a document to XLSX is a rather complicated process. To save your document to XLSX format using Aspose.Words, use the [XlsxSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.saving/xlsxsaveoptions/) class and the new `Xlsx` element in the [SaveFormat](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/saveformat/) enumeration. As mentioned above, you can save the document in any load format supported by Aspose.Words to XLSX.

The following code example shows how to save PDF to XLSX:
