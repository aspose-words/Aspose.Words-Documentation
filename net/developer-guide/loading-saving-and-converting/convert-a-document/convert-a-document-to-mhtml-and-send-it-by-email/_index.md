Aspose.Words can convert any document to the MHTML (Web Archive) format. This makes it convenient to use Aspose.Words and Aspose.Email together. You can load a predefined document in any supported format, such as DOC, OOXML, or RTF, into Aspose.Words, fill it with data, save the resulting document as MHTML, and then send it by e-mail using Aspose.Email.

The following code example shows how to convert any document to MHTML and send it by email:
