This page lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 15.9.0. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

## Added DocumentBuilder Public Methods for Creating EditableRanges.

We have added following methods in DocumentBuilder class in 15.9.0.

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Editable range in a document can overlap and span any range. To create a valid editable range you need to
/// call both <see cref="StartEditableRange"/> and <see cref="EndEditableRange()"/>
/// or <see cref="EndEditableRange(EditableRangeStart)"/> methods.</p>
/// <p>Badly formed editable range will be ignored when the document is saved.</p>
/// </remarks>
/// <returns>The editable range start node that was just created.</returns>
public EditableRangeStart StartEditableRange()

{{< highlight csharp >}}

/// Marks the current position in the document as an editable range end.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <p>Use this overload during creating nested editable ranges.</p>
/// <p>Editable range in a document can overlap and span any range. To create a valid editable range you need to

### Added Options to Control Image Stretching for LINQ Reporting Engine

WORDSNET-12077 has now been resolved and the documentation for the engine has been updated appropriately.

Note that there was a lack of documentation about using of charts with LINQ Reporting Engine, although this feature was included to 15.6 as per WORDSNET-10922. Now it is fixed.

The following documentation sections were added/modified:

- [Using Charts to Represent Sequential Data](/words/net/template-syntax/#using-charts-to-represent-sequential-data)
- [Inserting Images Dynamically](/words/net/template-syntax/#inserting-images-dynamically)
- [Pie Chart Template](/words/net/typical-templates/#pie-chart-template)
- [Scatter Chart Template](/words/net/typical-templates/#scatter-chart-template)
- [Bubble Chart Template](/words/net/typical-templates/#bubble-chart-template)
- [In-Table Template with Filtering, Grouping, and Ordering](/words/net/typical-templates/#in-table-template-with-filtering-grouping-and-ordering)
- [Chart Template with Filtering, Grouping, and Ordering](/words/net/typical-templates/#chart-template-with-filtering-grouping-and-ordering)

### Added ReportingEngine.Options Property

WORDSNET-12380 is now resolved. We have introduced following property in Aspose.Words 15.9.0.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets a set of flags controlling behavior of this <see cref="ReportingEngine"/> instance
/// while building a report.
/// </summary>
public ReportBuildOptions Options
{
    get;
    set;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

**C#**

{{< highlight csharp >}}
/// <summary>
/// Specifies options controlling behavior of <see cref="ReportingEngine"/> while building a report.
/// </summary>
[Flags]
public enum ReportBuildOptions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies default options.
    /// </summary>
    None = 0,
    /// <summary>
    /// Specifies that fields missing in a data source object should be treated as null literals by the engine.
    /// This option affects only fields of <ms><see cref="DataRow"/> and <see cref="IDataRecord"/> objects</ms>
    /// <java><see cref="DataTable"/> rows</java>. If this option is not set, the engine throws an exception
    /// when encounters a missing data field.
    /// </summary>
    AllowMissingDataFields = 1
