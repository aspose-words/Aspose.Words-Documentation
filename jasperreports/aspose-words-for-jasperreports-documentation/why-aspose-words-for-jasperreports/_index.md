## Support for Popular Microsoft Word Formats

Aspose.Words for JasperReports allows exporting reports as DOC and DOCX documents. Compared to RTF, these formats offer a number of advantages (smaller file size for example).

## Additional Export Formats

In addition to Microsoft Word formats, Aspose.Words for JasperReports offers export to RTF, ODT, HTML and TXT. More export formats will be available in the future. 

## Editable Documents

Aspose.Words for JasperReports exports flow layout documents. This means they consist of “normal” paragraphs, tables and images that are easy to further edit in Microsoft Word, if necessary. The built in JasperReports RTF exporter produces documents consisting of positioned text frames and that makes further editing hard.
