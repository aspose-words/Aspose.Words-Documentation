Please copy only jar library according to the version of installed JasperReports.

Two new options are implemented for better layout view. Now one can set following options:

- USE_EXACT_SPACINGS (default = false, in order not to touch logic for older reports). Use true for adding white spaces exactly how it is designed, without optimization.
- POSITIONED_STYLE (default = null). If not null then style with this particular name (from .jrxml) will be used for all empty cells in positioned tables
