LINQ Reporting Engine enables you to use the following built-in extension methods in template expressions:

- Extension methods mimicking the ones for `IEnumerable<T>` (see "Appendix A. Enumeration Extension Methods" for more information)
- Extension methods for iteration variables (see "Using Extension Methods of Iteration Variables" for more information)

**Note** â€“ Extension methods, other than the built-in ones, can be used only in the form of plain static methods in template expressions.
