[Charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart) transform complex data into visually engaging insights, making information
easier to digest and understand at a glance. By presenting trends and comparisons in a clear format, they empower
decision-makers to draw conclusions quickly and confidently. You can make a chart by filling a template document with
data using LINQ Reporting Engine in C#.\

The process of building a chart incorporates the following steps:

1. Preparing data for the chart in one of [supported formats]({{< ref "../binding-data/" >}})

2. Creating a chart template in Microsoft Word

3. Running C# code invoking [LINQ Reporting Engine
APIs](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.reporting/reportingengine/)

A typical chart template represents a regular Microsoft Word chart with special tags added to its title and series names:
A `foreach` tag binding the chart to a data collection, and `x` and `y` tags binding series data with values calculated
upon an item of the collection.
