A chart with a variable number of series allows for flexible visualization of changing or diverse data sets, enabling
easy comparison and trend identification. It provides a comprehensive view of the data and enhances data analysis
capabilities. You can make a chart with a variable number of series using LINQ Reporting Engine in C#.

Although this guide deals with a column chart, you can apply a similar approach to other chart types as well.

## How to Build a Chart with a Variable Number of Series

1. Prepare data for your chart in one of [formats supported by LINQ Reporting Engine]({{< ref "../../binding-data/" >}}),
for example, a JSON file as follows:
{{< highlight json >}}
{{< include chart-with-variable-number-of-series-data-1.json >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

2. In Microsoft Word, [create a
chart](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-chart-to-your-document-in-word-ff48e3eb-5e04-4368-a39e-20df7c798932)
and [format its
elements](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/format-elements-of-a-chart-b6c787d5-f90a-41d2-a901-9d3ed9f0dbf0)
to use it as a template.

3. [Add or remove data
series](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-data-series-to-your-chart-25340cfb-3fa3-428c-82cf-79983125df12)
to fit the maximum possible number of series as per your requirements and format the series as well.

4. Bind the chart to a data collection by adding a `foreach` tag to the end of the chart's title as per the example:
{{< highlight "c#" >}}
<<foreach [in items]>>
{{< /highlight >}}

5. Bind categories of the chart to a value calculated upon an item of the collection by appending an `x` tag to
the chart's title, for instance, like so:
{{< highlight "c#" >}}
<<x [project]>>
{{< /highlight >}}

6. For each of the chart's series, bind its data to a numeric value calculated upon an item of the collection by adding
a `y` tag to the series' name and optionally bind exclusion of the series to a Boolean value by adding a `removeif` tag
to the series' name similarly to the screenshot:\

<img src="chart-with-variable-number-of-series-template-series-data.png"
  alt="Series data of a chart with a variable number of series template for LINQ Reporting Engine in C#."
  style="width:770px"/>

7. Review your chart template before saving, it should look like this:\
\
<img src="chart-with-variable-number-of-series-template.png"
  alt="Chart with a variable number of series template for LINQ Reporting Engine in C#."
  style="width:578px"/>

8. Build your chart using LINQ Reporting Engine by running the following C# code:\
{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "2f7a15f32189afa4c8a2195926cedf7d" "building-chart-with-variable-number-of-series.cs" >}}

## Chart with a Variable Number of Series Report Example

After taking all the steps, LINQ Reporting Engine creates a chart report with all the series included as follows:\
\
<img src="chart-with-variable-number-of-series-report-1.png"
  alt="Chart with a variable number of series report created by LINQ Reporting Engine in C#."
  style="width:578px"/>

Now, let us consider the alternative case where data for the chart implies exclusion of one of the series, for example,
like so:
{{< highlight json >}}
{{< include chart-with-variable-number-of-series-data-2.json >}}
{{< /highlight >}}

After running the same code with the JSON file being used instead, LINQ Reporting Engine generates a chart report with
one of the series excluded like this:\
\
<img src="chart-with-variable-number-of-series-report-2.png"
  alt="Chart with a variable number of series report generated by LINQ Reporting Engine in C#."
  style="width:578px"/>

Thus, you can control which chart series to show or hide based on conditions.
