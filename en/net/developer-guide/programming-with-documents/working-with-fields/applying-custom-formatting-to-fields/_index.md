Sometimes users need to apply custom formatting to fields. In this article, we will look at a couple of examples of how this can be done.

To learn more options, see the full list of properties for each field type in the corresponding class in the [Fields namespace](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/).

## How to Apply Custom Formatting to Field Result

Aspose.Words provides API for custom formatting of field's result. You can implement [IFieldResultFormatter](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/ifieldresultformatter/) interface to control how the field result is formatted. You can apply numeric format switch, i.e. \# "#.##", date/time format switch, i.e. \@ "dd.MM.yyyy", andÂ number format switch, i.e. \* Ordinal.

The following code example shows how to apply custom formatting for the field result:

## How to evaluate `IF` condition

If you want to evaluate `IF` condition after mail merge, you can use the [EvaluateCondition](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/fieldif/evaluatecondition/) method that immediately returns the result of the expression evaluation.

The following code example shows how to use this method:

## How to Apply Custom Formatting to Time Field

By default Aspose.Words updates `TIME` field with current culture short time format. We figured out that there is a difference between Microsoft Word formatting and .NET/Windows formatting, and also between different .NET Framework versions. If you want to format the `TIME` field according to your requirement, you can achieve this by implementing [IFieldUpdateCultureProvider](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/ifieldupdatecultureprovider/) interface.

The following code examples shows how to apply custom formatting to the `TIME` field:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "eacc4fc7407a98d683f3084bb86d58f7" "Examples-CSharp-Programming-Documents-Fields-FieldUpdateCulture-FieldUpdateCultureProvider.cs" >}}
