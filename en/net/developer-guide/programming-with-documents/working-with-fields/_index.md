**Fields** in a document are like placeholders where useful data can be inserted. For example, a field can be a page reference, formula, or a Mail Merge field.

In a document created or edited with Aspose.Words, as in a Microsoft Word document, a field consists of a field code and a field result. The field code is an instruction about how the field result needs to be updated or calculated. An application that processes a document and encounters a field should interpret the instructions contained in the field code and update the field result with a new value.

In Aspose.Words, fields are represented by the [Fields](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/) namespace. Articles in this documentation section explain how to use Aspose.Words classes to manipulate document fields programmatically.
