Aspose.Words also provides some classes, methods and properties for working with footnotes and endnotes.

## Set Number of Footnote Layout Columns

You can set the number of footnote layout columns using the [Columns](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.notes/footnoteoptions/columns/) property. If this property has the value of 0, the footnotes area is formatted with a number of columns based on the number of columns on the displayed page.
