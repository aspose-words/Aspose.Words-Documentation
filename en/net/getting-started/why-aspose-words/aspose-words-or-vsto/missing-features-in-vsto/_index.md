As already described in previous articles, there are operations with documents that are faster and more conveniently to perform using Aspose.Words than VSTO. But there are also operations that are not provided by VSTO. You can try to achieve the desired result using auxiliary tools and options, but even if successful, it will be quite expensive.

The following table contains some of the popular features supported by Aspose.Words and missed in VSTO:

| Aspose.Words feature                                         | Corresponding documentation article or section               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Convert between Different Document Formats. For example, DOCX to DOC, Word to PDF,  HTML to Markdown, DOCX to JPG, PDF to Word, and others | The [Convert a Document](/words/net/convert-a-document/) section |
| Manipulate form fields                                       | The [Working with Form Fields](/words/net/working-with-form-fields/) article |
| Manipulate tables                                            | The [Working with Tables](/words/net/working-with-tables/) section |
| And others                                                   |                                                              |

The table is not complete, so you can check [our documentation](/words/net/) for the feature you are interested in.
