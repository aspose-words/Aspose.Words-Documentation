Qt is a C++ based cross-platform application development framework which is widely used to develop a variety of desktop, mobile, and embedded system applications. Aspose.Words for C++ can be integrated within Qt in order to create and manipulate Word documents in your Qt applications.
You can find complete Qt example at [GitHub](https://github.com/btolfa/Aspose.Words-for-C/tree/master/Showcases/DocumentExplorer)

## Using Aspose.Words for C++ within Qt Creator

For using Aspose.Words for C++ in your Qt application download the latest version of the API from the [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/words/cpp/) section. Once the API is downloaded, you can use integrate the C++ library within Qt Creator or you can use with Visual Studio.

In order to integrate and use Aspose.Words for C++ library within a Qt Console Application developed in Qt Creator, please follow the steps given below:

- Open Qt Creator and create a new *Qt Console Application*

- Select the `QMake` option from the *Build System* dropdown

- Select the appropriate kit and finish the wizard.
- Copy *Aspose.Words.Cpp* and *CodePorting.Native.Cs2Cpp_vc14_20.3* folders from the extracted package of Aspose.Words for C++ into the root of the project

- In order to add paths to lib and include folders, right-click on the project in the LHS panel and select *Add Library*

- Select the External Library option and browse paths to include and lib folders one by one

- Once done, your .pro project file will contain the following entries

- Build the application and you are done with the integration

- Select the External Library option and browse paths to include and lib folders one by one

- Once done, your .pro project file will contain the following entries

- Build the application and you are done with the integration

## Using Aspose.Words for C++ in Qt Applications within Visual Studio

For developing a Qt application using Visual Studio, you require to install [Qt Visual Studio Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools-19123). Once you have the installation, download the latest version of the API from the [downloads](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/cpp/) section and follow the steps given below:

- Download and install [CMake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.17.1/cmake-3.17.1-win64-x64.msi).
- Download and unpack [Aspose.Words for C++](https://releases.aspose.com/words/cpp/).
- Create a new folder for your project files and copy/paste *Aspose.Words.Cpp* and *CodePorting.Native.Cs2Cpp_vc14_20.4* folders from unpacked package.
- Create a new file named *CMakeLists.txt* in the same folder.
- Copy and paste the following content within the *CMakeLists.txt* file.

{{< highlight cpp >}}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1.0 FATAL_ERROR)

- Open *Command Prompt* and *cd* to the project folder.
- Run the following command by replacing *<path-to-qt5>* with the path to *Qt5Config.cmake* file (i.e. C:\QT\5.14.2\msvc2017_64\lib\cmake\Qt5).

{{< highlight bash >}}
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -Thost=x64 -Ax64 -S . -B build -D"Qt5_DIR=<path-to-qt5>"
{{< /highlight >}}

- Once you have completed the above-mentioned steps, a Visual Studio solution will be created in the folder. You are now ready to use Aspose.Words for C++ features within the Qt application.
