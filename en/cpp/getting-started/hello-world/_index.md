A "Hello, World!" code is often the first simple example to write uisng "Aspose.Words for C++", and it can also be used as a sanity test to ensure the software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed.

"Aspose.Words for C++" library gives developers direct access to create, modify, merge, convert, compare Word and Web documents. PDF, DOCX, DOC, RTF, ODT, EPUB, HTML and many other file formats are [supported](/words/cpp/supported-document-formats/).

Below code snippet follows these steps:

1. Create a new empty [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/document/)
1. Initialize a [DocumentBuilder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/documentbuilder/) class
1. Insert text to the document start using simple [Write](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/documentbuilder/write/) method
1. Open an existing [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/document/document/) from a file. Automatically detects the file format
1. [Append](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/document/appenddocument/) document "A" to the and of the document "B"
1. [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words/document/save/) the output as PDF

The following code snippet is a "Hello, World!" example to exhibit working of "Aspose.Words for C++" API:
