Structured document tags (SDT or content control) allow to embed customer-defined semantics as well as its behavior and appearance into a document.

[StructuredDocumentTag](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.markup/structureddocumenttag/) can occur in a document in the following places:

- Block-level – Among paragraphs and tables, as a child of a [Body](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/body/), [HeaderFooter](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/headerfooter/), [Comment](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/comment/), [Footnote](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.notes/footnote/) or a [Shape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/shape/) node.
- Row-level – Among rows in a table, as a child of a [Table](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.tables/table/) node.
- Cell-level – Among cells in a table row, as a child of a [Row](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.tables/row/) node.
- Inline-level – Among inline content inside, as a child of a [Paragraph](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/paragraph/).
- Nested inside another [StructuredDocumentTag](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.markup/structureddocumenttag/).
