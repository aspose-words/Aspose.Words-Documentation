Aspose.Words strives to support all features for all supported formats. Almost all features of Microsoft Word documents are supported and are faithfully preserved during conversion. Using Aspose.Words you can load and convert a document of any size and can easily handle the conversion of a document consisting of thousands of pages within seconds. The only limitation is the amount of available working memory on the machine.
