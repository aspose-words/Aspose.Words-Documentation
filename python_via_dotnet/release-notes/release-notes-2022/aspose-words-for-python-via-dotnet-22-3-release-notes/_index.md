## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.3. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added saving to PDF 2.0 and several other improvements in PDF output

Related issue: WORDSNET-23250

1. New value [PDF20](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfcompliance/#pdf20) added to [PdfCompliance](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfcompliance/) enum

2. Improvements in PDF digital signatures
Changed PDF digital signature type from "adbe.pcks7.sha1" to "adbe.pcks7.detached" to fit all supported PDF versions.
Added [PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.RIPE_MD160](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfdigitalsignaturehashalgorithm/#ripe_md160) value.
`PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.SHA1` and `PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.MD5` values are marked as obsolete.
Default value for [PdfDigitalSignatureDetails.hash_algorithm](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfdigitalsignaturedetails/hash_algorithm/) changed from [PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.SHA512](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfdigitalsignaturehashalgorithm/#sha512) to [PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm.SHA256](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfdigitalsignaturehashalgorithm/#sha256). SHA256 is most popular hashing algorithm, it is strong enough and it is used by default by Adobe Acrobat when signing the document.

3. Improvements in PDF encryption
Removed `PdfEncryptionAlgorithm` enum and `encryption_algorithm` parameter from [PdfEncryptionDetails](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfencryptiondetails/) constructor. This is a breaking change.
Now PDF 1.7 output is encrypted with AES-128 encryption algorithm and PDF 2.0 output with AES-256 algorithm.

4. Several options ([use_core_fonts](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/use_core_fonts/), [custom_properties_export](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/custom_properties_export/) in [PdfSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfsaveoptions/) cannot be used when saving PDF 2.0

5. Removed obsolete `PdfCompliance.PDF15` enum value

### Added FieldStart.field_data property

Related issue: WORDSNET-23198

The following public property is added to [FieldStart](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/fieldstart/) class:
{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def field_data(self) -> bytes:
    """Gets custom field data which is associated with the field."""
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(filename)
field = doc.range.fields[0]
print(len(field.start.field_data))
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added HtmlSaveOptions.save_shapes_as_svg public property

Related issue: WORDSNET-23235

This option controls whether [Shape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/shape/) nodes are converted to SVG images when saving to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. 
Default value is `False`.

If this option is set to `True`, [Shape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/shape/) nodes are exported as \<svg\> elements.
Otherwise, they are rendered to bitmaps and are exported as \<img\> elements.

Note that this options also affects text boxes, because they are represented by [Shape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/shape/) nodes.
As a result, if this option is set to `True`, it overrides the `export_text_box_as_svg` property
value and causes text boxes to be converted to SVG.

Use Case:
{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(filename)
save_options = aw.saving.HtmlSaveOptions()
save_options.export_shapes_as_svg = True
doc.save(output_filename, save_options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### AZW3 format is now supported for loading

Related issue: WORDSNET-22411

Aspose.Words can now load AZW3 documents (KF8 is another name of the format). Usually, documents in the AZW3 format have the ".azw3" or ".mobi" extension. However, a ".mobi" document may be in the older MOBI format, and some ".mobi" documents contain two versions of content - MOBI and AZW3 - for backward compatibility.

The following table explains what reader Aspose.Words uses to load MOBI and AZW3 documents in different cases:

![load-MOBI-and-AZW3-documents](MobiAzw3LoadFormat.png)

Currently, Aspose.Words always loads all topics from an AZW3 document in the order in which they appear in the table of contents.

The following publicly visible enum values were added:
- [LoadFormat.AZW3](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/loadformat/#azw3)

The [FileFormatUtil](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/fileformatutil/) class can now be used to determine if a file is an AZW3 document. For example, the following call
{{< highlight python >}}
info = aw.FileFormatUtil.detect_file_format("book.azw3");
{{< /highlight >}}

will return an info instance with the [FileFormatInfo.load_format](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/fileformatinfo/load_format/) property set to [LoadFormat.AZW3](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/loadformat/#azw3).

Currently, no load options have effect when loading AZW3 documents. [LoadOptions.resource_loading_callback](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.loading/loadoptions/resource_loading_callback/) is not invoked when loading AZW3 documents, because Aspose.Words expects all referenced resource files to be stored locally in the AZW3 document. Like in the Kindle reader, references to external resource files are ignored.

As a result, the only use cases for loading AZW3 documents that is currently available is the one illustrated below:
{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document("book.azw3")
{{< /highlight >}}

### Breaking change â€“ explicit Table.auto_fit() call may be required to make table structure match the specified cell widths in a builder scenario

A major update that handles tables with incorrect or missing column width data in the source document is released.

Cell/column width data and the number of columns spanned by a cell are re-calculated from table and cell properties. Column width data stored in the document are replaced by re-calculated values.

The algorithm imitates MS Word logic that does not use cell widths. (In fact, cell width is not even stored in .DOCX format used by MS Word).

The new logic may change the output for some document builder scenarios. In the following example the number of columns spanned by the cell in row 2 is no longer calculated automatically from the specified cell widths:
{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)

# First row
builder.start_table()

cell1 = builder.insert_cell()
cell1.cell_format.width = 100
builder.write("Text in cell 1.")

cell2 = builder.insert_cell()
cell2.cell_format.width = 100
builder.write("Text in cell 2.")

# End of first row
builder.end_row()

# Second row
cell3 = builder.insert_cell()
cell3.cell_format.width = 200
builder.write("Row 2 cell spans 2 columns.")

# End of second row
builder.end_row()
builder.end_table()

doc.update_page_layout()
doc.save("merged_cell.docx")
{{< /highlight >}}

The behavior was changed because cell width data proved to be unreliable in a number of generated documents.

In order to preserve the specified cell widths in the above scenario and calculate the number of columns spanned by a cell from cell width, Aspose.Words should be explicitly instructed by calling [Table.auto_fit()](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.tables/table/auto_fit/) method:
{{< highlight python >}}
...
table = builder.end_table()

# Re-calculate table structure from the specified cell widths.
table.auto_fit(aw.tables.AutoFitBehavior.FIXED_COLUMN_WIDTHS)
doc.update_page_layout()
doc.save("merged_cell.docx")
{{< /highlight >}}

This will also set table layout to fixed, which is better suited for preserving cell widths regardless of contents.

### Removed obsolete property FieldXE.has_page_range_bookmark_name

Removed obsolete property `FieldXE.has_page_range_bookmark_name`. Please, use the [FieldXE.page_range_bookmark_name](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/fieldxe/page_range_bookmark_name/) property instead.

### Added new Chart.source_full_name property

Related issue: WORDSNET-22664

The following public property has been added to the [Chart](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing.charts/chart/) class. If a chart is linked to an external xls/xlsx document, the property returns its file name.
{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def source_full_name(self) -> str:
    """Gets the path and name of an xls/xlsx file this chart is linked to."""
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document(filename)
shape = doc.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
print(shape.chart.source_full_name)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new ImportFormatOptions.force_copy_styles property

Related issue: WORDSNET-19268.

[ImportFormatOptions.force_copy_styles](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/importformatoptions/force_copy_styles/) is a boolean value indicating either to copy conflicting styles
in [ImportFormatMode.KEEP_SOURCE_FORMATTING](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/importformatmode/#keep_source_formatting) mode.
The default value is `False`.

By default, if a matching style already exists in a destination document, the source style formatting
is expanded into direct node attributes and the style of this node is reset to a default.

When this option is set to `True`, the source style will be forcibly copied
into destination document with unique name and applied to the imported node.

Note, in this case it is not guaranteed that formatting of the imported node in destination document
will be preserved.

Use Case: Explains how to force import styles in `KEEP_SOURCE_FORMATTING` mode.
{{< highlight python >}}
# There are MyStyle1 and MyStyle2 in both source and destination document.
# Also there is style MyStyle3 that exists only in source document.
src_doc = aw.Document("Src.docx")
dst_doc = aw.Document("Dst.docx")

options = aw.ImportFormatOptions()
options.force_copy_styles = True
node_importer = aw.NodeImporter(src_doc, dst_doc, aw.ImportFormatMode.KEEP_SOURCE_FORMATTING, options)

print("Imported styles:")
paras = src_doc.first_section.body.paragraphs
for i in range(paras.count):
    imported_para = node_importer.import_node(paras[i], True).as_paragraph()
    print(imported_para.paragraph_format.style_name)

# The code produces the following output:
# Imported styles:
# MyStyle1_0
# MyStyle2_0
# MyStyle3
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added saving to PDFUA-1

Related issue: WORDSNET-6614

New value [PDF_UA1](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfcompliance/#pdf_ua1) added to [PdfCompliance](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfcompliance/) enum.

The primary purpose of PDF/UA is to define how to represent electronic documents in the PDF format in a
manner that allows the file to be accessible.

### Removed obsolete property LayoutOptions.show_comments

Removes obsolete property `LayoutOptions.show_comments`.

Use [LayoutOptions.comment_display_mode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.layout/layoutoptions/comment_display_mode/) property instead:
{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document("in.docx")
doc.layout_options.comment_display_mode = aw.layout.CommentDisplayMode.SHOW_IN_BALLOONS
doc.save("out.pdf")
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new feature to save and load font search cache

Related issue: WORDSNET-22278

Loading previously saved font search cache will speed up the font cache initialization process. It is especially useful when access to font sources is complicated (e.g. when fonts are loaded via network).

To provide this feature following methods and properties has been added:
{{< highlight python >}}
class FontSettings:

    def save_search_cache(self, output_stream: io.BytesIO):
        """Saves the font search cache to the stream.
        
        :param output_stream: Output stream."""
        ...
     
    def set_fonts_sources(self, sources: List[aw.fonts.FontSourceBase], cache_input_stream: io.BytesIO):
        """Sets the sources where Aspose.Words looks for TrueType fonts and additionally loads previously saved
        font search cache.
    
        Loading previously saved font search cache will speed up the font cache initialization process. It is
        especially useful when access to font sources is complicated (e.g. when fonts are loaded via network).
    
        When saving and loading font search cache, fonts in the provided sources are identified via cache key.
        For the fonts in the SystemFontSource and FolderFontSource cache key is the path
        to the font file. For MemoryFontSource and StreamFontSource cache key is defined
        in the MemoryFontSource.cache_key and StreamFontSource.cache_key properties
        respectively. For the FileFontSource cache key is either FileFontSource.cache_key
        property or a file path if the FileFontSource.cache_key is None.
    
        It is highly recommended to provide the same font sources when loading cache as at the time the cache was saved.
        Any changes in the font sources (e.g. adding new fonts, moving font files or changing the cache key) may lead to the
        inaccurate font resolving by Aspose.Words.
    
        :param sources: An array of sources that contain TrueType fonts.
        :param cache_input_stream: Input stream with saved font search cache.
        """
        ...

 


class FileFontSource:

    def __init__(self, file_path: str, priority: int, cache_key: str):
        """Initializer.
        
        :param file_path: Path to font file.
        :param priority: Font source priority. See the FontSourceBase.priority property description for more information.
        :param cache_key: The key of this source in the cache. See cache_key property description for more information.
        """
        ...
     
    @property
    def cache_key(self) -> str:
        """The key of this source in the cache.
        
        This key is used to identify cache item when saving/loading font search cache with
        FontSettings.save_search_cache() and FontSettings.set_fonts_sources() methods.
    
        If key is not specified then file_path will be used as a key instead.
        """
        ...

 


class MemoryFontSource:

    def __init__(self, font_data: bytes, priority: int, cacheKey: str):
        """Initializer.
        
        :param font_data: Binary font data.
        :param priority: Font source priority. See the FontSourceBase.priority property description for more information.
        :param cache_key: The key of this source in the cache. See cache_key property description for more information.
        """
        ...
     
    @property
    def cache_key(self) -> str:

        This key is used to identify cache item when saving/loading font search cache with
        FontSettings.save_search_cache() and FontSettings.set_fonts_sources() methods.

{{< highlight python >}}
# Prepare font sources and generate font search cache beforehand.
file_source = aw.fonts.FileFontSource(file_path, file_source_priority, file_source_key)
