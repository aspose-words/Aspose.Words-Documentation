## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.6. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added new public constants to RevisionColor enum

Related issue: WORDSNET-23694

Starting from version 2019 of MS Word, it has the ability to set additional colors for revisions.
A new revision color constants have been added.
{{< highlight python >}}
class RevisionColor(enum.IntEnum):
    ...

    # Represents 0000ff color.
    CLASSIC_BLUE = 4

    # Represents ff0000 color.
    CLASSIC_RED = 5
{{< /highlight >}}

Now it is really easy to set new colors for the document revisions.

Use Case:
{{< highlight python >}}
# Set new color for the insert revisions
doc.layout_options.revision_options.inserted_text_color = aw.layout.RevisionColor.CLASSIC_BLUE
{{< /highlight >}}

### Changed behavior of Fill.one_color_gradient and Fill.two_color_gradient methods

Related issue: WORDSNET-22072

The following changes have been implemented:

1. Now the [one_color_gradient](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/fill/one_color_gradient/) and [two_color_gradient](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/fill/two_color_gradient/) methods of the [Fill](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/fill/) class can be used to create gradient fills in charts (see ChartDataPoint.format.fill, ChartMarker.format.fill and ChartSeries.format.fill properties). NotImplementedException was thrown in the previous versions.

2. Behavior of the following overloads of the [one_color_gradient](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/fill/one_color_gradient/) and [two_color_gradient](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.drawing/fill/one_color_gradient/) methods have been changed:
{{< highlight python >}}
class Fill:
    ...

    def one_color_gradient(self, color: drawing.Color, style: aw.drawing.GradientStyle, variant: aw.drawing.GradientVariant, degree: float):
        """Sets the specified fill to a one-color gradient using the specified color.
        
        :param color: The color to build the gradient.
        :param style: The gradient style.
        :param variant: The gradient variant.
        :param degree: The gradient degree. Can be a value from 0.0 (dark) to 1.0 (light)."""
        ...
 
    def two_color_gradient(self, color1: drawing.Color, color2: drawing.Color, style: aw.drawing.GradientStyle, variant: aw.drawing.GradientVariant):
        """Sets the specified fill to a two-color gradient.

        :param color1: The first color to build the gradient.
        :param color2: The second color to build the gradient.
        :param style: The gradient style.
        :param variant: The gradient variant."""
        ...
{{< /highlight >}}

In the past, their behavior was as if a gradient was created using the overloads without specifying colors, and then fore and back color were set. Now the behavior is reversed: as if you first define the colors, and then using the overloads to build the gradient.

### Removed obsolete PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm enum values

Related issue: WORDSNET-23473

Removed obsolete [PdfDigitalSignatureHashAlgorithm](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.saving/pdfdigitalsignaturehashalgorithm/) enum values `SHA1` and `MD5`.

SHA1 and MD5 hash algorithms for digital signature are deprecated in the latest PDF specification due to security issues. So, please, use the one of the available algorithms instead.

### Removed obsolete methods of ChartDataPointCollection and ChartDataLabelCollection classes

Related issue: WORDSNET-23633

The following obsolete methods have been removed:
{{< highlight python >}}
class ChartDataLabelCollection:
    ...

    def add(self, index: int) -> ChartDataLabel:
        """Adds new ChartDataLabel at the specified index.

        :param index: Target data label index.
        
        Obsolete. When ChartSeries.has_data_labels is True, all data labels are available in this collection."""
        ...
 
    def remove_at(self, index: int):
        """Clears format of a ChartDataLabel at the specified index.
        
        :param index: The zero-based index of the chart data label to clear format.
        
        Obsolete. Use the ChartDataLabel.clear_format method instead."""
        ...
 
    def clear(self):
        """Clears format of all ChartDataLabel in this collection.
        
        Obsolete. Use the clear_format method instead."""
        ...
 
class ChartDataPointCollection:
    ...

    def add(self, index: int) -> ChartDataPoint:
        """Adds new ChartDataPoint at the specified index.
        
        :param index: Target data point index.
        
        Obsolete. All data points are available in this collection."""
        ...

    def remove_at(self, index: int):
        """Clears format of a ChartDataPoint at the specified index.
        
        :param index: The zero-based index of the data point to clear format.
        
        Obsolete. Use the ChartDataPoint.clear_format method instead."""
        ...
 
    def clear(self):
        """Clears format of all ChartDataPoint in this collection.
        
        Obsolete. Use the clear_format method instead."""
        ...
