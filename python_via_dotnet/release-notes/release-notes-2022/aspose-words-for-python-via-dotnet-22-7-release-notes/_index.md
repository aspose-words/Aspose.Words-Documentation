## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words 22.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added a new mode for import HTML block-level elements during inserting HTML via DocumentBuilder.insert_html() method

Related issue: WORDSNET-23654

New HTML insertion option was added to HtmlInsertOptions enum.
{{< highlight python >}}
class HtmlInsertOptions(IntEnum):
    ...
    
    # Preserve properties of block-level elements.
    #
    # By default, properties of parent blocks are merged and stored on their child elements (i.e. paragraphs or tables).
    # If this option is specified, properties of each block are stored separately in a special logical structure.
    # As a result, this option allows to better preserve individual borders and margins seen in the HTML document
    # and get better conversion results. The downside is that the resulting document gets harder to modify, since borders
    # and margins stored in the logical structure are not available for editing.
    #
    # Only margins and borders of 'body', 'div', and 'blockquote' HTML elements are preserved. Properties of each HTML
    # element are stored separately.
    #
    # If this option is specified, Aspose.Words mimics MS Word's behavior regarding import of block properties.
    PRESERVE_BLOCKS = 4

{{< /highlight >}}

The new mode of import HTML block-level elements during inserting HTML via DocumentBuilder.insert_html() method allows to better preserve borders and margins seen in the HTML document and get better conversion results.
{{< highlight python >}}
html = """
<html>
    <div style='border:dotted'>
        <div style='border:solid'>
            <p>paragraph 1</p>
            <p>paragraph 2</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</html>
"""

# Set the new mode of import HTML block-level elements.
insert_options = aw.HtmlInsertOptions.PRESERVE_BLOCKS
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder()
builder.insert_html(html, insert_options)
builder.document.save(my_dir + "sample.docx")
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public property shadow_format

Related issue: WORDSNET-23877

A new public shadow_format property has been added to ShapeBase class
{{< highlight python >}}
class ShapeBase:
    ...

    @property
    def shadow_format(self) -> aw.drawing.ShadowFormat:
        """Gets shadow formatting for the shape."""
        ...
{{< /highlight >}}

With this property customers can set or get one of the preset shadow types.
{{< highlight python >}}
class ShadowFormat:
    ...

    @property
    def type(self) -> aw.drawing.ShadowType:
        """Gets the specified ShadowType for ShadowFormat."""
        ...

    @type.setter
    def type(self, value: aw.drawing.ShadowType):
        """Sets the specified ShadowType for ShadowFormat."""
        ...
{{< /highlight >}}

Users can also get information about a shadow's visibility.
{{< highlight python >}}
class ShadowFormat:
    ...

    @property
    def visible(self) -> bool:
        """Returns True if the formatting applied to this instance is visible.
        
        Unlike clear(), assigning False to visible does not clear the formatting,
        it only hides the shape effect."""
        ...
{{< /highlight >}}

And it is also possible to clear ShadowFormat.
{{< highlight python >}}
class ShadowFormat:
    ...

    def clear(self):
        """Clears shadow format."""
        ...
{{< /highlight >}}

Use Case:
{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document("DocumentWithShape.docx")
shape = doc.first_section.body.get_child(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
# Checking whether the shadow effect is visible and whether the preset type is SHADOW2.
if shape.shadow_format.visible and shape.shadow_format.shape_type == aw.drawing.ShapeType.SHADOW2:
    # Setting the preset shadow type to SHADOW7.
    shape.shadow_format.type = aw.drawing.ShadowType.SHADOW7
# Checking whether the shadow is customized, i.e. the preset type is SHADOW_MIXED.
if shape.shadow_format.type == aw.drawing.ShadowType.SHADOW_MIXED:
    # Clearing ShadowFormat.
    shape.shadow_format.clear()
{{< /highlight >}}
	
### ReportBuildOptions.RESPECT_JPEG_EXIF_ORIENTATION enum member

Related issue: WORDSNET-23295

The following member has been added to the ReportBuildOptions enum:
{{< highlight python >}}
class ReportBuildOptions(IntEnum):
    ...

    # Specifies that the engine should use EXIF â€‹â€‹image orientation values to appropriately rotate inserted
    # JPEG images.
    RESPECT_JPEG_EXIF_ORIENTATION = 16
{{< /highlight >}}

The option can be applied while building a report in the following way:
{{< highlight python >}}
engine = aw.reporting.ReportingEngine()
engine.options |= aw.reporting.ReportBuildOptions.RESPECT_JPEG_EXIF_ORIENTATION
engine.build_report(...)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new class for saving PDFs to other fixed formats

Related feature task: WORDSNET-23059

We've added a new way to work with PDF input files. Now they can be converted into a fixed format without using Words layout model.

I.e. the feature runs without Document class and returns the result in a stream object.

Example:
{{< highlight python >}}
pdf_renderer = aw.pdf2word.fixedformats.PdfFixedRenderer();
options = aw.pdf2word.fixedformats.PdfFixedOptions()
options.page_index = 0
options.page_count = 2
result_stream = pdf_renderer.save_pdf_as_html(pdf_stream, options)
{{< /highlight >}}

Pros:
 - More accurate conversion (positions of text and other elements).
 - Better performance and memory usage (less logic to run, no need to build flow models, etc).

Cons:
 - The list of output formats is limited for now (PDF, Html, XPS, Jpeg, Png, Tiff, Bmp).
 - There is no way to edit the data during the conversion.
 - A small amount of options such as Password, page range and Jpeg image quality.

Supported methods:
{{< highlight python >}}
save_pdf_as_html(...)
save_pdf_as_xps(...)
save_pdf_as_images(...)
save_pdf_as_pdf(...)
{{< /highlight >}}

Available options:

 - page_index and page_count can be used to select a subset of pages.
 - password - allows to decode an encrypted PDF. The result would be decrypted.
 - jpeg_quality - can be provided before save_pdf_as_images calls to setup output Jpeg image quality.
 - image_format - should be used to specify the output image format for save_pdf_as_images.
 
 All options are optional and can be ommited in favor of default values.
