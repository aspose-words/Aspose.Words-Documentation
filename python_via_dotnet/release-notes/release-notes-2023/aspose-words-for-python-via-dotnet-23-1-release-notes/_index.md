## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 23.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added Font property to ChartDataLabel and ChartDataLabelCollection classes

Related issue: WORDSNET-24652

The **Font** property has been added to the **ChartDataLabel** and **ChartDataLabelCollection** classes:

{{< highlight python >}}
class ChartDataLabel:
    @property
    def font(self) -> aspose.words.Font:
        # Provides access to the font formatting of this data label.
        ...

class ChartDataLabelCollection:
    @property
    def font(self) -> aspose.words.Font:
        '''Provides access to the font formatting of the data labels of the entire series.
        
        Value defined for this property can be overridden for an individual data label with using the
        :attr:`ChartDataLabel.font` property.'''
        ...

doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)

# Create a column chart.
shape = builder.insert_chart(aw.drawing.charts.ChartType.COLUMN, 432, 252)
series_collection = shape.chart.series
series_collection.clear()

# Add a chart series.
series = series_collection.add("Series 1",
    ["Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 3", "Category 4", "Category 5"],
    [5.5, 2, 3.5, 6, 9])

# Display data labels.
series.has_data_labels = True
labels = series.data_labels
labels.show_value = True

# Set font size for all labels of the series.
labels.font.size = 12

# Let's use a constant for simplicity.
min_value_index = 1
# Let's use a constant for simplicity.
max_value_index = 4

# Mark the labels for the max and min values.
labels[min_value_index].font.size = 14
labels[min_value_index].font.color = drawing.Color.red
labels[max_value_index].font.size = 14
labels[max_value_index].font.color = drawing.Color.green

doc = aw.Document("Test.docx", lo)

doc.save("Test.pdf")
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added MetafileRenderingOptions.UseGdiRasterOperationsEmulation and overall improvements in metafile raster operations emulation

Related issue: #WORDSNET-24003

Metafile raster operations emulations have been improved.

Also added an option to use GDI+ in raster operations emulation process.

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def use_gdi_raster_operations_emulation(self) -> bool:
    '''Gets or sets a value determining whether or not to use the GDI+ for raster operations emulation.
    
    Windows GDI+ library could be used to emulate raster operations. It provides support for all raster operation
    comparing to Aspose.Words own emulation but performance may be slower in some cases.
    
    When this value is set to ``True``, Aspose.Words uses GDI+ for raster operations emulation.
    
    When this value is set to ``False``, Aspose.Words uses its own implementation of raster operations emulation.
    
    This option is used only when metafile is rendered as vector graphics.
    
    The default value is ``False``.'''
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public properties for working with shading theme colors

Related issue: WORDSNET-24456

A new public properties **foreground_pattern_theme_color** and 88background_pattern_theme_color** has been added to the **Shading** class.

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def foreground_pattern_theme_color(self) -> aspose.words.themes.ThemeColor:
    '''Gets or sets the foreground pattern theme color in the applied color scheme that is associated with this :class:`Shading` object.'''
    ...

@foreground_pattern_theme_color.setter
def foreground_pattern_theme_color(self, value: aspose.words.themes.ThemeColor):
    ...

@property
def background_pattern_theme_color(self) -> aspose.words.themes.ThemeColor:
    '''Gets or sets the background pattern theme color in the applied color scheme that is associated with this :class:`Shading` object.'''

    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to work with shading theme colors. Please see the following code example to learn how to use such properties:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document("c:\\Documents\\TestDocument.docx")

shading = doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.paragraph_format.shading
# Gets and sets the values of theme colors.
if shading.foreground_pattern_theme_color == aw.themes.ThemeColor.ACCENT1:
    shading.foreground_pattern_theme_color = ThemeColor.DARK1

if shading.background_pattern_theme_color == aw.themes.ThemeColor.ACCENT2:
    shading.background_pattern_theme_color == aw.themes.ThemeColor.DARK2

# Gets and sets the lightens values.
if shading.foreground_tint_and_shade == 0:
    shading.ForegroundTintAndShade = 0.5

if shading.background_tint_and_shade == 0:
    shading.background_tint_and_shade = -0.2

doc.save("output.docx")
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added public property Range.Revisions

Related issue: WORDSNET-24257

A new public property **revisions** has been added to the **Range** class:

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def revisions(self) -> aspose.words.RevisionCollection:
    '''Gets a collection of revisions (tracked changes) that exist in this range.
    
    The returned collection is a "live" collection, which means if you remove parts of a document that contain
    revisions, the deleted revisions will automatically disappear from this collection.'''
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to get actual revisions from the node range. Please see the following code example to learn how to use such a property:

for revision in paragraph.range.revisions:
    if revision.revision_type == aw.RevisionType.DELETION:
        revision.accept()
# Getting the first section revisions.
doc.first_section.range.revisions.reject_all()
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added the ability to generate TOC (table of contents) for AZW3 documents

Related issue: WORDSNET-24389

Now Aspose.Words can generate TOC (table of contents) for AZW3 documents.

Desired depth of TOC can be specified same way as it's done for EPUB documents using **HtmlSaveOptions.epub_navigation_map_level** property.

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to create AZW3 document with a two-level TOC. Please see the following code example to learn how to use such a property:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document()

options = aw.saving.HtmlSaveOptions(aw.SaveFormat.AZW3)
options.epub_navigation_map_level = 2

doc.save(MY_DIR + "DocumentWithTwoLevelTOC.azw3", options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added the ability to specify how list items will be written to the Markdown

Related issue: WORDSNET-24544

The following public enumeration is added to **aspose.words.saving** module:

{{< highlight python >}}
class MarkdownListExportMode:
    '''Specifies how lists are exported into Markdown.'''

    # Export list items compatible with Markdown syntax.
    MARKDOWN_SYNTAX: int
    # Export list items as plain text.
    PLAIN_TEXT: int

{{< /highlight >}}

The following public property is added to **MarkdownSaveOptions** class:

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def list_export_mode(self) -> aspose.words.saving.MarkdownListExportMode:
    '''Specifies how list items will be written to the output file.
    Default value is :attr:`MarkdownListExportMode.MARKDOWN_SYNTAX`.
    
    When this property is set to :attr:`MarkdownListExportMode.PLAIN_TEXT` all list labels are
    updated using :meth:`aspose.words.Document.update_list_labels` and exported with their actual values. Such lists
    can be non-compatible with Markdown format and will be recognized as plain text upon importing in this case.
    
    When this property is set to :attr:`MarkdownListExportMode.MARKDOWN_SYNTAX`, writer tries to export
    list items in manner that allows to numerate list items in automatic mode by Markdown.'''
    ...

@list_export_mode.setter
def list_export_mode(self, value: aspose.words.saving.MarkdownListExportMode):
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to export document with plain text numbering into Markdown. Please see the following code example:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
doc = aw.Document("input.docx")

# Set option to export list items as plain text.
options = aw.saving.MarkdownSaveOptions()
options.list_export_mode = aw.saving.MarkdownListExportMode.PLAIN_TEXT
doc.save("output.md", options)
{{< /highlight >}}

### HtmlSaveOptions.ScaleImageToShapeSize now also affects grouped raster images

Related issue: WORDSNET-24065

Behavior of the **HtmlSaveOptions.scale_image_to_shape_size** property was changed to affect groups of raster images.

Previously, **HtmlSaveOptions.scale_image_to_shape_size** didn't affect grouped raster images and they were always scaled to shape size and were rendered using the resolution value specified in **HtmlSaveOptions.image_resolution**. If grouped images were high resolution, their quality would reduce considerably because of scaling.

Now Aspose.Words tries to preserve quality of grouped high resolution images. If a group of raster images is saved to HTML and the **HtmlSaveOptions.scale_image_to_shape_size** property is set to false, Aspose.Words computes max intrinsic resolution among all images in the group and if it is greater than the value specified in **HtmlSaveOptions.image_resolution**, the group is rendered using the computed increased resolution. This doesn't eliminate scaling completely but reduces its impact on grouped high resolution raster images.

### OfficeMath.EquationXmlEncoding property was marked as obsolete

Related issue: WORDSNET-24770

The **OfficeMath.equation_xml_encoding** property has been marked as obsolete because it is not intended to be used in the API.

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def equation_xml_encoding(self) -> str:
    '''Gets/sets an encoding that was used to encode equation XML, if this office math object is read from
    equation XML.'''
    ...

@equation_xml_encoding.setter
def equation_xml_encoding(self, value: str):
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}
