## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 23.3. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added new public properties for working with fill colors

A new public properties **fore_theme_color** and **back_theme_color** has been added to the **Fill** class.

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def fore_theme_color(self) -> aspose.words.themes.ThemeColor:

    ...
    
@fore_theme_color.setter
def fore_theme_color(self, value: aspose.words.themes.ThemeColor):
    ...
    
@property
def back_theme_color(self) -> aspose.words.themes.ThemeColor:
    '''Gets or sets a ThemeColor object that represents the background color for the fill.'''
    ...
    
@back_theme_color.setter
def back_theme_color(self, value: aspose.words.themes.ThemeColor):
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

A new public properties **fore_tint_and_shade** and **back_tint_and_shade** has been added to thr **Fill** class.

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def fore_tint_and_shade(self) -> float:

    The allowed values are within the range from -1 (the darkest) to 1 (the lightest) for this property.
    Zero (0) is neutral. Attempting to set this property to a value less than -1 or more than 1
    results in System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException.'''
    ...

@fore_tint_and_shade.setter
def fore_tint_and_shade(self, value: float):
    ...
    
@property
def back_tint_and_shade(self) -> float:
    '''Gets or sets a double value that lightens or darkens the background color.
        
    The allowed values are within the range from -1 (the darkest) to 1 (the lightest) for this property.
    Zero (0) is neutral. Attempting to set this property to a value less than -1 or more than 1
    results in System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException.'''
    ...

@back_tint_and_shade.setter
def back_tint_and_shade(self, value: float):
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to work with **theme colors** and **tint and shade**. Please see the following code example to learn how to use such properties:

doc = Document("in.docx")

shape = doc.get_child(NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True)
shape_fill = typing.cast(Shape, shape).fill

'''Gets and sets the value of theme colors.'''
if shape_fill.fore_theme_color == ThemeColor.ACCENT1:
    shape_fill.fore_theme_color(ThemeColor.DARK1)

if shape_fill.back_theme_color == ThemeColor.ACCENT2:
    shape_fill.back_theme_color(ThemeColor.DARK2)

text_fill_1 = doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.runs[0].font.fill

'''Gets and sets the tint value.'''
if text_fill_1.fore_tint_and_shade == 0:
    text_fill_1.fore_tint_and_shade(0.5)

text_fill_2 = doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.runs[1].font.fill
    
'''Gets and sets the shade value.'''
if text_fill_2.fore_tint_and_shade == 0:
    text_fill_2.fore_tint_and_shade(-0.2)
