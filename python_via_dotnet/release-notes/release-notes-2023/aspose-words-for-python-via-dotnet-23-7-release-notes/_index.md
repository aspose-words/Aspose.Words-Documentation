## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

This section lists public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET 23.7. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Words for Python via .NET which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as regression and modifies the existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### Added ability to get digital signature value from digitally signed document as byte array

Added ability to get a digital signature value from a digitally signed document into **Aspose.Words.DigitalSignatures.DigitalSignature** class:

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def signature_value(self) -> bytes:
    '''Gets an array of bytes representing a signature value.'''
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to obtain digital signature value as byte array from a document:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
import base64
from aspose.words import Document

doc = Document("docWithSign.docx")
for digitalSignature in doc.digital_signatures:
    signatureValue = base64.b64encode(digitalSignature.signature_value)
    print(digitalSignature)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new EPS image format

The document page or shape could be saved into **EPS** format now. A new EPS value is added into **SaveFormat** class.

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to save document as EPS image:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
from aspose.words import Document, SaveFormat
from aspose.words.saving import ImageSaveOptions, PageSet

# Open some document.
doc = Document("document.docx")

# Save the second page as EPS image.
saveOptions = ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.EPS)
saveOptions.page_set = PageSet(1)
doc.save("image.eps", saveOptions)
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to save any particular shape as EPS image:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
from aspose.words import Document, NodeType, SaveFormat
from aspose.words.saving import ImageSaveOptions
# Open some document.
doc = Document("document.docx")

# Save the shape as EPS image.
saveOptions = ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.EPS)

shape = doc.get_child(NodeType.SHAPE, 0, True).as_shape()
renderer = shape.get_shape_renderer()
renderer.save("image.eps", saveOptions)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Added new public properties Row.next_row, Row.previous_row, Cell.next_cell and Cell.previous_cell

The following public properties have been added to the **Row** class:

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def next_row(self) -> aspose.words.tables.Row:
    '''Gets the next :class:`Row` node.
    
    The method can be used when you need to have typed access to table rows. If a
    :class:`aspose.words.markup.StructuredDocumentTag` node is found in a table instead of a row,
    it is automatically traversed to get a row contained within.'''
    ...

@property
def previous_row(self) -> aspose.words.tables.Row:
    '''Gets the previous :class:`Row` node.
    
    The method can be used when you need to have typed access to table rows. If a
    :class:`aspose.words.markup.StructuredDocumentTag` node is found in a table instead of a row,
    it is automatically traversed to get a row contained within.'''
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

The following public properties have been added to the **Cell** class:

{{< highlight python >}}
@property
def next_cell(self) -> aspose.words.tables.Cell:
    '''Gets the next :class:`Cell` node.
    
    The method can be used when you need to have typed access to cells of a :class:`Row`. If a
    :class:`aspose.words.markup.StructuredDocumentTag` node is found in a row instead of a cell, it is automatically
    traversed to get a cell contained within.'''
    ...

@property
def previous_cell(self) -> aspose.words.tables.Cell:
    '''Gets the previous :class:`Cell` node.
    
    The method can be used when you need to have typed access to cells of a :class:`Row`. If a
    :class:`aspose.words.markup.StructuredDocumentTag` node is found in a row instead of a cell, it is automatically
    traversed to get a cell contained within.'''
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to enumerate through all table cells:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
from aspose.words import Document

doc = Document(fileName)
table = doc.first_section.body.tables[0]

# Enumerate through all cells of the table.
row = table.first_row
while row is not None:
    cell = row.first_cell
    
    while cell is not None:
        print(cell.get_text())
        cell = cell.next_cell
    
    row = row.next_row
{{< /highlight >}}

### A warning is issued if loaded HTML document has fixed-page structure

Aspose.Words doesn't support loading of fixed-page HTML document (for example, documents that are produced when saving in **SaveFormat.HtmlFixed**).
If Aspose.Words detects that the loaded HTML document has fixed-page structure, it will issue the following warning:

{{< highlight python >}}
WarningSource.HTML
WarningType.MINOR_FORMATTING_LOSS
"The document is fixed-page HTML. Its structure may not be loaded correctly."
{{< /highlight >}}

### Supported mustache tags in the MailMerge.GetRegionsHierarchy and MailMerge.GetFieldNamesForRegion methods

Now the **MailMerge.get_regions_hierarchy** method returns mustache regions and mustache fields when the **MailMerge.use_non_merge_fields** option is True.

Now the **MailMerge.get_field_names_for_region** method accepts mustache region names and returns mustache field names when the **MailMerge.use_non_merge_fields** option is True.

The **MustacheTag** class has been introduced:

{{< highlight python >}}
class MustacheTag:
    '''Represents "mustache" tag.'''
    
    @property
    def reference_run(self) -> aspose.words.Run:
        '''Gets the run that contains the beginning of the tag.'''
        ...
    
    @property
    def reference_offset(self) -> int:
        '''Gets the zero-based starting position of the tag from the start of the :attr:`MustacheTag.reference_run`.'''
        ...
    
    @property
    def text(self) -> str:
        '''Gets the text of the tag.'''
        ...
    
    ...
{{< /highlight >}}

The start_mustache_tag, end_mustache_tag and mustache_tags properties have been added to the MailMergeRegionInfo class:

{{< highlight python >}}
class MailMergeRegionInfo:

    @property
    def mustache_tags(self) -> list[aspose.words.mailmerging.MustacheTag]:
        '''Returns a list of child "mustache" tags.'''
        ...
     
    @property
    def start_mustache_tag(self) -> aspose.words.mailmerging.MustacheTag:
        '''Returns a start "mustache" tag for the region.'''
        ...
    
    @property
    def end_mustache_tag(self) -> aspose.words.mailmerging.MustacheTag:
        '''Returns an end "mustache" tag for the region.'''
        ...
{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}

**Use Case**

This use case explains how to use MustacheTag:

{{% /alert %}}

{{< highlight python >}}
from aspose.words import Document
document = Document("Template.docx")
document.mail_merge.use_non_merge_fields = True

hierarchy = document.mail_merge.get_regions_hierarchy()
for mustacheTag in hierarchy.mustache_tags:
    print(mustacheTag.text)

for region in hierarchy.regions:
    print(region.start_mustache_tag.text)
    print(region.end_mustache_tag.text)
{{< /highlight >}}
