Sometimes, you may have a document that needs a review, but you do not want reviewers to randomly modify your content. Aspose.Words allows you to make the permission of your document read-only so that the content can be copied or read, but not modified. This will prevent content from being removed or added to your document.

Applying the read-only option to your document does not prevent someone from creating a new copy of it and saving it with another name.

This article explains how to make a document read-only.

## Make a Document Read-Only

Aspose.Words has the public class **aspose.words.settings.WriteProtection** that specifies write protection settings for a document. You do not create instances of this class directly.

Write protection shows whether the author has recommended opening a document as read-only and/or requiring a password to modify the document.

Aspose.Words allows you to make a document read-only to restrict editing by using the **read_only_recommended** property and the **set_password** method.

In Microsoft Word, you can create a Read-Only document in a similar way using both:

* “Always Open Read-Only” (File → Info → Protect Document)
* "Password to modify" (Save As → Tools → General Options → Password)

{{% /alert %}}

Users can also restrict document editing by selecting **ProtectionType** as **READ_ONLY**, but this is another feature that provides more advanced protection capabilities. There is such a function in Microsoft Word, respectively, it is implemented in Aspose.Words.

**ProtectionType** will be described in detail in one of the following articles – “Restrict Document Editing”.

{{% /alert %}}

The **read_only_recommended** property is password-secured, so if you do not set a password before applying the **read_only_recommended** property, then other users can simply open the document as if it were unprotected. You access the document protection settings and set a write protection password via the **set_password** method.

Note that the password being set is just a property in a document that can be removed if the document properties are accessed. Accordingly, such a password is not a guarantee of the document security.

{{% /alert %}}

If you need to check if a document has a write protection password that restricts it from editing, you can use the **is_write_protected** property.

The following code example shows how to make a document read-only:

{{< highlight python >}}
import aspose.words as aw

doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)

builder.write("Open document as read-only")

# Enter a password that's up to 15 characters long.
doc.write_protection.set_password("MyPassword")

# Make the document as read-only.
doc.write_protection.read_only_recommended = True

# Apply write protection as read-only.
doc.protect(aw.ProtectionType.READ_ONLY)
doc.save(docs_base.artifacts_dir + "DocumentProtection.ReadOnlyProtection.docx")
{{< /highlight >}}

## Remove Read-Only Restriction

If you do not want a user to open your document as read-only, you can simply set the **read_only_recommened** property to *False* or select **ProtectionType** as **NO_PROTECTION**.

The following code example shows how to remove read-only access for a document:

{{< highlight python >}}
import aspose.words as aw

doc = aw.Document()
            
# Enter a password that's up to 15 characters long.
doc.write_protection.set_password("MyPassword")

# Remove the read-only option.
doc.write_protection.read_only_recommended = False

# Apply write protection without any protection.
doc.protect(aw.ProtectionType.NO_PROTECTION)
doc.save(docs_base.artifacts_dir + "DocumentProtection.RemoveReadOnlyRestriction.docx")
